Russian Federation) \\n \\nRequest for the indication of provisional measures \\nI. INTRODUCTION (PARAS. 1-16) \\n The Court recalls that, on 16  January 2017, Ukraine instituted proceedings against the \\nRussian Federation with regard to alleged violations of the International Convention f or the \\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism (ICSFT) and the International Convention on the \\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD).  On the same day, Ukraine submitted a \\nrequest for the indication of provisional measures, aimed at sa feguarding the rights it claims under \\nthose two conventions pending the Court’s decision on the merits. \\n With respect to the ICSFT, in paragraph  23 of its Request for the indication of provisional \\nmeasures, Ukraine asked the Court to indicate the following provisional measures: \\n“(a) The Russian Federation shall refrain from any action which might aggravate or \\nextend the dispute under the Terrorism Financing Convention before the Court or \\nmake this dispute more difficult to resolve. \\n(b) The Russian Federatio n shall exercise appropriate control over its border to \\nprevent further acts of terrorism financing, including the supply of weapons from \\nthe territory of the Russian Federation to the territory of Ukraine. \\n(c) The Russian Federation shall halt and prevent all transfers from the territory of the \\nRussian Federation of money, weapons, vehicles, equipment, training, or \\npersonnel to groups that have engaged in acts of terrorism against civilians in \\nUkraine, or that the Russian Federation knows may in the future  engage in acts of \\nterrorism against civilians in Ukraine, including but not limited to the ‘Donetsk \\nPeople’s Republic’, the ‘Luhansk People’s Republic’, the ‘Kharkiv Partisans’, and \\nassociated groups and individuals. \\n(d) The Russian Federation shall take all measures at its disposal to ensure that any \\ngroups operating in Ukraine that have previously received transfers from the \\nterritory of the Russian Federation of money, weapons, vehicles, equipment, \\ntraining, or personnel will refrain from carrying out a cts of terrorism against \\n With respect to CERD, in paragraph  24 of its Request for the indication of provisional \\nmeasures, Ukraine asked the Court to indicate the following provisional measures: \\n“(a) The Russian Federation shall refr ain from any action which might aggravate or \\nextend the dispute under CERD before the Court or mak e it more difficult to \\nresolve. \\n(b) The Russian Federation shall refrain from any act of racial discrimination against \\npersons, groups of persons, or institut ions in the territory under its effective \\ncontrol, including the Crimean peninsula. \\n(c) The Russian Federation shall cease and desist from acts of political and cultural \\nsuppression against the Crimean Tatar people, including suspending the decree \\nbanning the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People and refraining from enforcement \\nof this decree and any similar measures, while this case is pending. \\n(d) The Russian Federation shall take all necessary steps to halt the disappearance of \\nCrimean Tatar individuals and  to promptly investigate those disappearan ces that \\nhave already occurred. \\n(e) The Russian Federation shall cease and desist from acts of political and cultural \\nsuppression against the ethnic Ukrainian people in Crimea, including suspending \\nrestrictions on Ukrainian-language education and respecting ethnic Ukrainian \\nlanguage and educational rights, while this case is pending.” \\n The Court is fully aware of the context in which the present case has been brought before it, \\nin particular the fighting taking plac e in large parts of eastern Ukraine and the destruction, on \\n17 July 2014, of Malaysia Airlines Flight  MH17 while it was flying over Ukrainian territory en \\nroute between Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur, which have claimed a large number of lives.  \\nNevertheless, the case before the Court is limited in scope.  In respect of the events in the eastern \\npart of its territory, Ukraine has brought proceedings only under the ICSFT.  With regard to the \\nevents in Crimea, Ukraine’s claim is based solely upon CERD and the Cou rt is not called upon, as \\nUkraine expressly recognized, to rule upon any issue other than allegations of racial discrimination \\nmade by the latter. \\nII. PRIMA FACIE JURISDICTION (PARAS. 17-62) \\n The Court begins by observing that,  when a request for the indic ation of provisional \\nmeasures is submitted to it, it need not satisfy itself in a definitive manner that it has jurisdiction as \\nregards the merits of the case .  In the present case, it notes that Ukraine seeks to found the \\njurisdiction of the Court on Article 24, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT and on Article 22 of CERD.  The \\nCourt must therefore first seek to determine whether the jurisdictional clauses contained in these \\ninstruments prima facie confer upon it jurisdiction to rule on the merits of the case, enabling it — if \\nthe other necessary conditions are fulfilled — to indicate provisional measures. \\n1. Existence of a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of  \\nthe ICSFT and CERD (paras. 22-39) \\n After observing that Ukraine and the Russian Federat ion are parties to both conventions at \\nissue in the present case, the Court points out that both Article  24, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT and \\nArticle 22 of CERD make the Court’s jurisdiction conditional on the existence of a dispute arising \\nout of the interpr etation or application of the respectiv e c onvention.  At this stage of the \\npoint of law or fact between the two States;  and (2) whether that disagreement concer ns “the \\ninterpretation or application” of the respective convention. \\n(a) The International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism  \\n(paras. 24-31) \\n The Court considers that, as it appears from the record of the proceedings, the Parties differ \\non the question of whether the events which occurred in eastern Ukra ine starting from the spring \\nof 2014 have given rise to issues relating to their rights and obligations under the ICSFT.  It notes \\nthat Ukraine contends that the Russian Federation has failed to respect its obligations under \\nArticles 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 18.  In particular, Ukraine maintains that the Russian Federation has \\nfailed to take appropriate measures to prevent the financing of terrorism in Ukraine by public and \\nprivate actor s on the territory of the Russian Federation and that it has repeatedly refused to \\ninvestigate, prosecute, or extradite “offenders within its territory brought to its attention by \\nUkraine”.  The Russian Federation positively denies that it has committed an y of the violations set \\nout above. \\n The Court considers that at least some of the allegations made by Ukraine appear to be \\ncapable of falling within the scope of the ICSFT ratione materiae .  It is of the view that the \\nabove-mentioned elements are sufficien t at this stage to establish prima facie the existence of a \\ndispute between the Parties concerning the interpretation and application of the ICSFT.  During the \\nhearings, the question of the definition of “funds” in Article  1, paragraph 1, of the Convention was \\nraised.  The question was also raised whether acts of financing of terrorist activities by the State \\nitself fall within the scope of the Convention.  For the purposes of determining the existence of a \\ndispute relating to the Convention, the Court considers that it does not need to make any \\npronouncement on these issues. \\n(b) The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  \\n(paras. 32-39) \\n The Court considers that, as evidenced by the documents before it, the Parties differ on the \\nquestion of whether the events which occurred in Crimea starting from late February  2014 have \\ngiven rise to issues relating to their right s and obligations under CERD.  The Court notes that \\nUkraine has claimed that the Russian Federation viol ated its obligations under this Convention by \\nsystematically discriminating against and mistreating the Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians in \\nCrimea, suppressing the political and cultural expression of Crimean Tatar identity, banning the \\nMejlis, prevent ing Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians from gathering to celebrate and \\ncommemorate important cultural events, and by suppressing the Crime an Tatar language and \\nUkrainian-language education.  The Russian Federation has positively denied that it has commit ted \\nany of the violations set out above. \\n The Court is of the view that the  acts referred to by Ukraine, in particular the banning of the \\nMejlis and the alleged restrictions upon the cultural and educational rights of Crimean Tatars and \\nethnic Ukrainians, appear to be capable of falling within the scope of CERD  ratione materiae.  In \\nits opinion, the above -mentioned elements are sufficient at this stage to establish prima facie the \\nexistence of a dispute between the Parties concerning the interpretation and application of CERD. \\n2. Procedural preconditions (paras. 40-61) \\n The Court further notes that the ICSFT and CERD set out procedural preconditions to be \\nfulfilled prior to  the seisin of the Court.  Thus, under Article  24, paragraph  1, of the I CSFT, a \\ndispute that “cannot be settled through negotiation within a reasonable time” shall be submitted to \\narbitration at the request of one of the parties , and may be referred to the Court only if the parties \\nrequest.  Under Article 22 of CERD, the dispute referred to the Court must be a dispute “not settled \\nby negotiation or by the procedures expressly provided for in this Convention”.  In addition, \\nArticle 22 states that  the dispute may be referred to the Court at the request of one of the parties \\nthereto only if the parties have not agreed to another mode of settlement.  The Court notes that \\nneither Party contests that this latter condition is fulfilled in the case. \\n Regarding the negotiations to which both compromissory clauses refer, the Court observes \\nthat negotiations are distinct from mere protests or disputations and require a genuine attempt by \\none of the parties to engage in discussions with the other party, with a view to resolving the \\ndispute.  Where negotiations are attempted or have commenced, the precondition of negotiation is \\nonly met when the attempt to negotiate has been unsuccessful or where negotiations have failed, \\nbecome futile or deadlocked.  In order to meet the precondition of negotiation contained in the \\ncompromissory clause of a treaty, the subject -matter of the negotiations must relate to the \\nsubject-matter of the dispute, which, in turn, must concern the substantive obligations cont ained in \\nthe treaty in question. \\n At this stage of the proceedings, the Court first has to assess whether it appears that Ukraine \\ngenuinely attempted to engage in negotiations with the Russian Federation, with a view to \\nresolving their dispute concerning the latter’s compliance with its substantive obligations under the \\nICSFT and CERD, and whether Ukraine pursued these negotiations as far as possible.  With regard \\nto the dispute under the ICSFT, if the Court finds that negotiations took place but failed, it will also \\nhave to examine whether, prior to the seisin of the Court, Ukraine attempted to settle this dispute \\nthrough arbitration, under the conditions provided for in Article 24, paragraph 1, of the Convention.  \\nWith regard to CERD, along with the precondition of negot iation, Article  22 includes another \\nprecondition, namely the use of “the procedures expressly provided in the Convention”. In this \\ncontext, the Court will need to determine whether, for the purpose s of its decision on the r equest \\nfor the indication of prov isional measures, it is necessary to examine the question of the \\nrelationship between both preconditions and Ukraine’s compliance with the second one. \\n(a) The International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism  \\n(paras. 47-54) \\n The Court notes that it appears from the record of the proceedings that issues relating to the \\napplication of the ICSFT with regard to the situation in eastern Ukraine have been raised in \\nbilateral contacts and negotiations between the Parties.  Diplomatic exchanges have taken place, in \\nwhich Ukraine specifically referred to alleged breaches by the Russian Federation of its obligations \\nunder the ICSFT.  Over a period of two years, the Parties also held four in -person negotiating \\nsessions specifically addressed to the ICSFT.  These facts demonstrate that, prior to the filing of the \\nApplication, Ukraine and the Russian Federation had engaged in negotiations concerning the \\nlatter’s compliance with its substantive obligations under the ICSFT.  It appears from the fact s on \\nthe record that these issues could not then be resolved by negotiations. \\n With regard to the precondition relating to the submission of the dispute to arbitration, the \\nCourt notes that by a Note Verbale dated 19 April 2016, Ukraine submitted a request for arbitration \\nto the Russian Federation.  The Russian Federation responded by means of a Note Verbale dated \\n23 June 2016, in which it offered to discuss “issues concerning setting up” the arbitration at a \\nmeeting it suggested should be held a month late r.  By a Note Verbale dated 31  August 2016, \\nUkraine proposed to the Russian Federation to resort to the mechanism of an ad hoc chamber of \\nthis Court.  In its Note Verbale to Ukraine, dated 3  October 2016, the Russian Federation rejected \\nthis proposal and s ubmitted its own draft arbitration agreement and accompanying rules of \\nprocedure.  At a meeting on 18  October 2016, the Parties discussed the organization of the \\narbitration but no agreement was reached.  Further exchanges between the Parties did not resol ve \\nthe impasse.  It appears that, within six months from the date of the arbitration request, the Parties \\n The Court is of the view that the above-mentioned elements are sufficient at this stage to \\nestablish, prima facie, that the procedural preconditions under Article  24, paragraph  1, of the \\nICSFT for the seisin of the Court have been met. \\n(b) The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  \\n(paras. 55-61) \\n The Cour t recalls that it has earlier concluded that the terms of Article  22 of CERD \\nestablished preconditions to be fulfilled  before the seisin of the Court .  It notes that, as evidenced \\nby the record of the proceedings, issues relating to the application of that Convention with regard to \\nthe situation in Crimea have been raised in bilateral contacts and negotiations between the Parties, \\nwhich have exchanged numerous diplomatic Notes and held three rounds of bilateral negotiations \\non this subject.  These facts demonstrate that, prior to the filing of the Application, Ukraine and the \\nRussian Federation engaged in negotiations regarding the question of the latter’s compliance with \\nits substantive obligations under CERD.  It appears from the record that these issues h ad not been \\nresolved by negotiations at the time of the filing of the Application. \\n Article 22 of CERD also refers to “the procedures expressly provided for” in the Convention.  \\nAccording to Article 11 of the Convention, “if a State Party considers that another State Party is not \\ngiving effect to the provisions of this Convention”, the matter may be brought to the attention of \\nthe CERD Committee.  Neither Party claims that the issues in dispute have been brought to the \\nattention of the CERD Committee.  Alth ough both Parties agree that negotiations and recourse to \\nthe procedures referred to in Article  22 of CERD constitute preconditions to be fulfilled before the \\nseisin of the Court, they disagree as to whether these preconditions are alternative or cumulativ e.  \\nThe Court considers that it need not make a pronouncement on the issue at this stage of the \\nproceedings.  Consequently, the fact that Ukraine did not bring the matter before the CERD \\nCommittee does not prevent the Court from concluding that it does have prima facie jurisdiction. \\n The Court considers, in view of all of the foregoing, that the procedural preconditions under \\nArticle 22 of CERD for the seisin of the Court have, prima facie, been complied with. \\n3. Conclusion as to prima facie jurisdiction (para. 62) \\n In light of the foregoing, the Court considers that, prima facie, it has jurisdiction pursuant to \\nArticle 24, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT and Article  22 of CERD to deal with the case to the extent \\nthat the dispute between the Parties relates to the  “interpretation or app lication” of the respective \\nconvention. \\nIII. THE RIGHTS WHOSE PROTECTION IS SOUGHT AND  \\nTHE MEASURES REQUESTED (PARAS. 63-86) \\n The Court recalls that its power to indicate provisional measures under Article  41 of the \\nStatute has as i ts object the preservation of the respective rights claimed by the parties in a case, \\npending its decision on the merits thereof.  It follows that the Court must be concerned to preserve \\nby such measures the rights which may subsequently be adjudged by it to belong to either party.  \\nTherefore, the Court may exercise this power only if it is satisfied that the rights asserted by the \\nparty requesting such measures are at least plausible.  Moreover, a link must exist between the \\n1. The International Convention for the Suppression of the  \\nFinancing of Terrorism (paras. 65-77) \\n The Court notes that the ICSFT imposes a number of obligations on States parties with \\nregard to the preventi on and suppression of the financing of terrorism.  However, for the purposes \\nof its request for the indication of provisional measures, Ukraine invokes its rights and the \\nrespective obligations of the Russian Federation solely under Article  18 of the Conve ntion.  \\nArticle 18 states in substance that States parties are obliged to co -operate to prevent the financi ng \\nof terrorism, i.e., the provision or collection of funds with the intention that they should be used or \\nin the knowledge that they are to be used in order to carry out acts of terrorism as defined in \\nArticle 2 of the Convention.  Consequently, in the context of a request for the indication of \\nprovisional measures, a State party to the Convention may rely on Article  18 to require another \\nState party to co-operate with it in the prevention of certain types of acts only if it is plausible that \\nsuch acts constitute offences under Article 2 of the ICSFT. \\n The Court observes that the acts to which Ukraine refers have given rise to the death and \\ninjury of a large number of civilians.  However, in order to determine whether the rights for which \\nUkraine seeks protection are at least plausible, it is necessary to ascertain whether there are \\nsufficient reasons for considering that the elements set out in Article  2, such as intention and \\nknowledge, as well as  the element of  purpose, are present.  The Court is of the view that , at this \\nstage of the proceedings, Ukraine has not put before it evidence which affords a sufficient basis to \\nfind it plausible that these e lements are present.  Therefore, it concludes that the conditions \\nrequired for the indication of provisional measures in respect of the rights alleged by Ukraine on \\nthe basis of the ICSFT are not met.  The Court points out that this conclusion is without p rejudice \\nto the Parties’ obligation to comply with the requirements of the ICSFT, and, in particular, \\nArticle 18 thereof. \\n2. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of  \\nRacial Discrimination (paras. 78-86) \\n The Court notes that CERD imposes a number of obligations on States parties with regard to \\nthe elimination of racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations.  For the purposes of \\nCERD, the term “racial discrimination” includes discriminatio n on the basis of ethnic origin.  The \\nCourt observes that there is a correlation between respect for individual rights, the obligations of \\nStates parties under CERD and the right of States parties to seek compliance therewith. \\n The Court notes that Articles  2 and  5 of CERD are intended to  protect individuals from \\nracial discrimination.  Consequently, in the context of a request for the indication of provisional \\nmeasures, a State party to CERD may avail itself of the rights under Articles  2 and 5 only if it is \\nplausible that the acts compla ined of constitute acts of racial discrimination under the Convention .  \\nIn the present case, on the basis of the evidence presented before the Court by the Parties, it appears \\nthat some of the acts complained of by Ukraine fulfil this condition of plausibility.  This is the case \\nwith respect to the banning of the Mejlis and the alleged restrictions on the educational rights of \\nethnic Ukrainians. \\n The Court turns to the issue of the link between the rights claimed and the provisional \\nmeasures requested.  It observes that the provisional measures sought by Ukraine are aimed at \\npreventing the Russian Federation from committing acts of racial discrimination against persons, \\ngroups of persons, or institutions in the Crimean peninsula (point (b));  preventing acts of political \\nand cultural suppression against the Crimean Tatar people, including suspending the decree \\nbanning the Mejlis (point (c));  preventing the disappearance of Crimean Tatar individuals and \\nensuring prompt investigation of disappearances that hav e already occurred (point (d));  and \\npreventing acts of political and cultural suppression against the ethnic Ukrainian people in Crimea, \\nalready recalled, the re must be a link between the measures which are requested and the rights \\nwhich are claimed to be at risk of irreparable prejudice.  In the current proceedings, this is the ca se \\nwith respect to the measures  aimed at safeguarding the rights of Ukraine under  Articles 2 and 5 of \\nCERD, with regard to the ability of the Crimean Tatar community to conserve its representative \\ninstitutions and with regard to the need to ensure the availability of Ukrainian -language education \\nin schools in Crimea. \\nIV. RISK OF IRREPARABLE PREJUDICE AND URGENCY (PARAS. 87-98) \\n Taking account of its earlier conclusion that the conditions required for the indication of \\nprovisional measures in respect of the rights invoked by Ukraine on the basis of the ICSFT are not \\nmet, the Court considers that the issue of the risk of irreparable prejudice and urgency arises only in \\nrelation to the provisional measures sought with regard to CERD. \\n The Court recalls that it has the power to indicate provisional measures when irreparable \\nprejudice could b e caused to rights which are the subject of judicial proceedings, but that this \\npower will be exercised only if there is urgency, in the sense that there is a real and imminent risk \\nthat irreparable prejudice will be caused to the rights in dispute before the Court gives its final \\ndecision. \\n The Court notes that certain rights in question in these proceedings, in particular the \\npolitical, civil, economic, social and cultural rights stipulated in Article  5, paragraphs (c), (d) and \\n(e) of CERD, are of such a nature that prejudice to them is capable of causing irreparable harm.  \\nBased on the information before it at this juncture, the Court is of the opinion that Crimean Tatars \\nand ethnic Ukrainians in Crimea appear to remain vulnerable. \\n In this regard, the Co urt takes note of the report on the human rights situation in Ukraine \\n(16 May to 15  August 2016), whereby the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for \\nHuman Rights ( OHCHR) acknowledged that “the ban on the Mejlis, which is a self -government \\nbody with quasi-executive functions, appears to deny the Crimean Tatars  \\uf0be an indigenous people \\nof Crimea \\uf0be the right to choose their representative institutions”, as well as of the report on the \\nhuman rights situation in Ukraine (16  August to 15  November 2016), in which the OHCHR \\nexplained that none of the Crimean Tatar NGOs currently registered in Crimea can be considered \\nto have the same degree of representativeness and legitimacy as the Mejlis, elected by the Crimean \\nTatars’ assembly, namely the Kurultai.  Th e Court also takes note of the report of the OSCE \\nHuman Rights Assessment Mission on Crimea (6  to 18  July 2015), according to which \\n“[e]ducation in and of the Ukrainian language is disappearing in Crimea through pressure on school \\nadministrations, teachers , parents and children to discontinue teaching in and of the Ukrainian \\nlanguage”.  The OHCHR has observed that “[t]he start of the 2016-2017 school year in Crimea and \\nthe city of Sevastopol confirmed the continuous decline of Ukrainian as a language of ins truction” \\n(report on the human rights situation in Ukraine (16 August to 15 November 2016)).  These reports \\nshow, prima facie, that there have been restrictions in terms of the availab ility of \\nUkrainian-language education in Crimean schools. \\n The Court considers that there is an imminent risk that the acts, as set out above, could lead \\nto irreparable prejudice to the rights invoked by Ukraine. \\nV. CONCLUSION AND MEASURES TO BE ADOPTED (PARAS. 99-105) \\n The Court concludes that the conditions required by its S tatute for it to indicate provisional \\nmeasures in respect of CERD are met.  Reminding the Russian Federation of its duty to comply \\nwith its obligations under CERD, the Court considers that, with regard to the situation in Crimea, \\nimposing limitations on the ability of the Crimean Tatar community to conserve its representative \\ninstitutions, including the Mejlis.  In addition, the Russian Federation must ensure th e availability \\nof education in the Ukrainian language.  The Court also deems it necessary to indicate a measure \\naimed at ensuring the non-aggravation of the dispute between the Parties. \\n With regard to the situation in eastern Ukraine, the Court reminds th e Parties that the \\nSecurity Council, in its resolution  2202 (2015), endorsed the “Package of Measures for the \\nImplementation of the Minsk Agreements”, adopted and signed in Minsk on 12  February 2015.  \\nThe Court expects the Parties, through individual and j oint efforts, to work for the full \\nimplementation of this “Package of Measures” in order to achieve a peaceful settlement of the \\nconflict in the eastern regions of Ukraine. \\nVI. OPERATIVE CLAUSE (PARA. 106) \\n The full text of the final paragraph of the Order reads as follows: \\n“For these reasons, \\nTHE COURT, \\nIndicates the following provisional measures, \\n(1) With regard to the situation in Crimea, the Russian Federation must, in accordance \\nwith its obligations under the International Convention on the Eliminatio n of All \\nForms of Racial Discrimination, \\n(a) By thirteen votes to three, \\nRefrain from maintaining or imposing limitations on the ability of the Crimean Tatar \\ncommunity to conserve its representative institutions, including the Mejlis; \\nIN FAVOUR :  President ABRAHAM;  Vice-President YUSUF;  Judges OWADA, \\nBENNOUNA, CANÇADO TRINDADE, GREENWOOD, DONOGHUE, GAJA, SEBUTINDE, \\nBHANDARI, ROBINSON, CRAWFORD;  Judge ad hoc POCAR; \\nAGAINST:  Judges TOMKA, XUE;  Judge ad hoc SKOTNIKOV; \\n(b) Unanimously, \\nEnsure the availability of education in the Ukrainian language; \\n(2) Unanimously, \\nBoth Parties shall refrain from any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute \\nbefore the Court or make it more difficult to resolve.” \\n Judge OWADA appends a separate opinion to the Order of the Court;  Judge TOMKA appends \\na declaration to the Order of the Court;  Judges  CANÇADO TRINDADE and BHANDARI append \\nseparate opinions to the Order of the Court;  Judge  CRAWFORD appends a declaration to the Order \\nof the Court;  Judges  ad hoc POCAR and SKOTNIKOV append separate opinions to the Order of the \\nCourt. \\n \\nSeparate opinion of Judge Owada \\n In light of the rationale of the provisional measures and of the jurisprudence of the Court  on \\nthis matter, the requirements for provisional measures consists of two categories, i.e., prima facie \\njurisdiction of the Court and the plausibility of rights asserted, which relate to the scope of the legal \\nframework for the Court’s exercise of its power under Article 41 of the Statute, while the other two \\nrequirements, i.e., the risk of irreparable prejudice and urgency, belong to the discretiona ry power \\nof the Court to determine whether to indicate provisional measures or not.  \\n Based on this understanding, the first two categories can only be a provisional determination, \\nand the applicable standard , especially for the plausibility test must be fairly low. The relevant \\njurisprudence of the Court corroborates this, and the choice of the word “plausible”  suggests that it \\nis equivalent to “possible” or “arguable” that the rights asserted exists. \\n In the present case, the rights asserted by Ukraine under the ICSFT are plausible, the Court’s \\nproposition in its paragraph 74 that “a State party to the [ICSFT] may rely on Article  18 to require \\nanother State party t o co -operate with it in the prevention of certain types of acts only if it is \\nplausible that such acts constitute offences under Article  2 of the ICSFT”  does not agree with the \\nestablished jurisprudence. All that Ukraine should be required to show is that its asserted rights \\nunder the ICSFT are “plausible” or “arguable”.  \\n Nevertheless, Judge Owada considers that the requesting party has not met the test of the real \\nand imminent risk of irreparable prejudice in the present case, since many uncertainties persist as to \\nwhether the flow of financing as well as military supplies from one place to another is taking place  \\nand if so by whom and for what purpose. Furthermore, the asserted rights under Article  18 of the \\nICSFT could not be said to be at imminent risk in the sense that irreparable prejudice cannot be \\nsaid to exist at this stage as Ukraine may still meaningfully demand the Russian Federation to seek \\nfor co-operation in good faith to implement its obligation for the future. For these different reasons, \\nJudge Owada concurs  with the Court’s decision not to grant prov isional measures concerning \\nthe ICSFT. \\nDeclaration of Judge Tomka \\n Although Judge Tomka agrees that the Russian Federation has certain obligations under the \\nInternational Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , he considers \\nthat the order made by the Court under point 1 (a) of the operative clause goes too far.  He observes \\nthat the activities of the Mejlis were banned by order of the Supreme Court of Crimea, affirmed on \\nappeal, due to alleged “extremist activities”.  He notes that the Court has given no consideration to \\nthe reasons for that ban which are elucidated in those decisions.  Moreover, he observes that this \\nCourt does not act as a court of appeal from national courts and should not overturn domestic court \\ndecisions, in particular not at the stage of proceedings relating to requests for the indication of \\nprovisional measures.   \\n Judge Tomka notes that the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms  of \\nRacial Discrimination guarantees freedom from racial discrimination in the enjoyment of particular \\nrights, but that the underlying rights are subject to possible limitations.  He notes that the Court \\nmust, in considering whether to order provisional me asures, weigh the parties’ respective rights.  \\nWhile the Parties are in dispute regarding sovereignty over Crimea, an issue which is not before the \\nCourt, there is no dispute between the Parties as far as the applicability of the International \\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in that territory is concerned.  \\nIrrespective of the legal basis for the exercise of its control and jurisdiction in Crimea, the Russian \\n Finally, Judge Tomka considers that Ukraine did not establish that there was urgency in this \\ncase.  He notes that Ukraine’s claims are likely to be adjudicated in the next four years and that the \\nRussian Federation pointed to the existence of other organizations that appear to be in a position to \\nadvance the interests of the Crimean Tatar community, at least to some extent, during the \\nintervening period.  \\nSeparate opinion of Judge Cançado Trindade \\n 1. In his separate o pinion, compos ed of 12  parts, Judge  Cançado Trindade begins by \\nexplaining that, although he has concurred with his vote to the adoption of the present Order \\nindicating Provisional Measures of Protection, there are related issues underlying the present \\ndecision of the ICJ but left out of its reasoning, which he feels obliged to dwell upon, and to leave \\non the records the foundations of his own personal position thereon.  Those issues are:   \\n(a) conceptual development of provisional measures of protection;  (b) the test of vulnerability of \\nsegments of the population (human vulnerability in international case-law, and in the cas d’espèce);  \\n(c) utmost vulnerability of victims, further irreparable harm, and urgency of the situation;   (d) the \\ndecisive test: human vulnerability over “plausibility” of rights;  (e) the necessity and importance of \\nprovisional measures of protection in the cas d’espèce ;  (f) the concern of the international \\ncommunity with the living conditions of the population everywhere;  (g) provisional measures, and \\nthe protection of the human person, beyond the strict inter -State dimension;  (h) chronic violence \\nand the tragedy of human vulnerability;   (i) provisional measures, and the protection of people in \\nterritory;  and (j) the autonomous legal regime of pro visional measures of protection:  duty of \\ncompliance with them, non -compliance and State responsibility, prompt determination of their \\nbreaches, and duty of reparation. \\n 2. He begins by recalling the conceptual development of provisional measures of protec tion, \\nand their gradual transposition from domestic into international (procedural) law, in the first half of \\nthe XXth century, in international arbitral and judicial practice  (part II).  Their juridical preventive \\ncharacter has thereby been clarified, sin gling out their relevance to the progressive development of \\ninternational law itself.  Judge Cançado Trindade ponders that “ [p]rovisional measures of \\nprotection have indeed evolved historically, in my perception, from precautionary legal measures in \\ndomestic procedural law into jurisdictional guarantees of a preventive character in international \\nprocedural law, endowed with a truly tutelary character” (para. 4). \\n 3. Furthermore, \\uf0be he proceeds, \\uf0be provisional measures of protection have paved the way \\nfor continuous monitoring , in prolonged situations of extreme gravity and urgency, seeking to \\navoid irreparable damage to persons, in particular those in a situation of great vulnerability, if not \\ndefencelessness (para.  5).  It is thus important to keep on devotin g attention to the conceptual \\ndevelopment o f the  autonomous legal regime  (para. 8) of those measures.   In this respect, \\nJudge Cançado Trindade recalls that, along the years (from 1999 up to the present), he has \\nidentified \\uf0be in two international jurisdictio ns wherein such measures are endowed with a \\nconventional basis \\uf0be obligations emanating from provisional measures of protection per se , \\ndistinct from obligations eventually ensuing from a Judgment as to the merits (and reparations);  \\nfurthermore, non-compliance with the former \\uf0be as well as the latter \\uf0be generates the responsibility \\nof the State, with legal consequences. \\n 4. The rights in provisional measures are not necessarily identical to those vindicated in the \\nmerits stage.  The injured party or victim ma y, in Judge Cançado Trindade’s perception, appear \\npromptly in the realm of provisional measures of protection, in case of non -compliance with them.  \\nAccordingly, non -compliance with, or breach of, such measures, engages autonomously the \\nprotection, irrespective of the subsequent Judgments as to the merits of the concrete cases (para. 9).  \\nHence the utmost importance of compliance with those measures for the realization of justice itself, \\nand for the progressive development of international law, in face of the “increasing violence in the \\nworld today, everywhere”;  there is thus need “to keep on enhancing the institute of provisional \\nmeasures of protection” (para. 10). \\n 5. The present case  of the Application of the ICSFT Convention and of the CERD \\nConvention, \\uf0be he proceeds, referring to the ICJ ’s relevant jurisprudence constante, \\uf0be is not the \\nfirst one wherein the alleged vulnerability of segments of the population concerned is brought to \\nthe Court’s attention, in its consideration of provisional measures of protection.  The greater the \\nhuman vulnerability, the greater the needs of protection of those affected by it.  It is thus  \\n“significant that, in our times, case s pertaining to situations of extreme adversity or \\nvulnerability of human beings have been brought to the attention of the ICJ as well as \\nother international tribunals.  This is, in my perception, a sign of the new paradigm of \\nthe humanized international l aw, the new jus gentium  of our times, sensitive and \\nattentive to the needs of protection of the human person in any circumstances of \\nvulnerability.  The case -law of international human rights tribunals is particularly \\nillustrative in this respect” (para. 17, and cf. para. 53). \\n 6. After reviewing such international case -law, Judge Cançado Trindade focuses on human \\nvulnerability in the present case, a point raised in the Request for provisional measures in the \\ncas d’espèce, in respect of the fundamental right to life and other basic rights of the members of the \\naffected segments of the population (paras. 21-22).  He recalls that, in the oral phase of the present \\nproceedings (public hearings before the ICJ of 06 -09.03.2017), the contending parties addressed, \\neach one in its own way, the test of vulnerability of segments of the population, in face of massive \\ninternal displacement and other fatalities in the areas affected (paras. 23-26). \\n 7. In addition,  \\uf0be he continues,  \\uf0be also “in the documents submitted to the ICJ by both \\nparties, shortly before the public hearings, evidence was produced of the utmost vulnerability of \\nsegments of the local population (e.g., in eastern Ukraine)”, for example, “several reports on the \\nhuman rights situation in Ukraine (mainly of th e Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \\nfor Human Rights , OHCHR), containing accounts of indiscriminate shelling  of the civilian \\npopulation from all sides ” (para. 27, and cf. paras.  28-29 and 31-33).  And he adds that, according \\nto those reports, \\n “For instance, indiscriminate shelling has struck and damaged residential \\nbuildings, hospitals, ambulances, schools, kindergartens, and a school football pitch.  \\nIn addition to the attacks on schools (encompassing the military use of them), the \\nOHCHR also reports attacks on churches (including on priests and parishioners).  In \\nsome towns, up to 80 per cent of residential buildings and public facilities have been \\ndestroyed.  Those injured and killed as a result of indiscriminate shelling have \\nincluded women, children, and elderly people, among others” (para. 30). \\n 8. There are also reports from other entities, e.g., the Organization for Security and \\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), which refer to “ongoing hostilities, shelling and general \\ninsecurity”, and “seri ous human rights violations”, as the main reason for the massive internal \\ndisplacement of persons in the areas affected  (paras. 34-35).  In face of the aforementioned \\nindiscriminate shelling of civilians, bringing to the fore the high probability of furthe r irreparable \\ndamage, and the urgency of the situation, the test of human vulnerability , in \\n‘plausibility’ of rights, for the indication of provisional measures of prot ection, whose ultimate \\nbeneficiaries, in the present circumstances, are human beings” (para. 36). \\n 9. In his understanding, the misgivings of the use of the so-called “plausibility” test by the \\nCourt (paras. 37-38) end up “creating a difficulty or obstacle  for the consideration and adoption of \\nprovisional measures of protection in relation to the dispute as a whole before the Court, \\nencompassing both the ICSFT and the CERD Conventions, and extending to both Crimea and \\neastern Ukraine” (para. 39).  He points out that this is not the first time within the ICJ that he deems \\nit fit to warn against the uncertainties surrounding the so-called “plausibility” test (cf. para. 40). \\n 10. He finds it regrettable that, along the present Order in the cas d’espèce,  \\n“the ICJ distracts attention from the key test of the vulnerability of victims (which it \\njust briefly refers to, as in para s. 92 and 96) to the inconsistencies of so -called \\n‘plausibility’, whatever that might concretely mean.  The rights to be protected in the \\ncas d’espèce are rights ultimately of human beings (individually or in groups), to a far \\ngreater extent than rights of States” (para. 41).   \\nAnd he adds: \\n “The Court is here faced with a situation where the fundamental rights to life \\n(and of living) and to the security and integrity of the person are at stake, in the \\ncircumstances of the cas d’espèce.  The individuals concerned live (or survive) in a \\nsituation of great vulnerability. (. . .) \\n The requirements for the granting of provisional measures of prote ction are the \\ngravity of the situation, the urgency of the need of such measures, and the probability \\nof irreparable harm.  They are met in a situation like that of the cas d’espèce, putting \\nat stake, in eastern Ukraine, the fundamental rights to life and to the security and \\nintegrity of the person, among others.  They are insufficiently dealt with, or even \\neluded, in the present C ourt’s Order, which, on the other hand, abounds in the \\naforementioned inconsistencies of invocation of the ‘plausibility’ test. \\n As I have been sustaining along the years, time and time again, provisional \\nmeasures of protection have an autonomous legal regime of their own.  This being so, \\nit is clear to me that human vulnerability is a test even more compelling than \\n‘plausibility’ of rights for the indication or ordering of provisional measures of \\nprotection.  In so acknowledging and sustaining, one is contributing to the ongoing \\nhistorical process of humanization of contemporary international law” (paras. 42-44). \\n 11. In the presen t case of the Application of the ICSFT Convention and of the CERD \\nConvention, in his understanding the Court is entitled and obliged, in view of the evidence \\nproduced before it, to indicate provisional measures of protection, on the basis of both the ICSFT \\nConvention and of the CERD Convention (para.  45).  At the stage of provisional measures, the \\nCourt cannot make definitive findings of fact nor findings of attribution of responsibility,  \\uf0be issues \\nto be determined later on, at the stage of the merits; at th e present stage, “the ICJ  \\uf0be as the \\nInternational Court of Justice, \\uf0be is under the duty to focus, on the basis of the evidence produced, \\non the protection of the vulnerable civilian population living (or surviving) in the areas concerned” \\n(para. 46).  This situation, \\uf0be he proceeds, \\uf0be \\n“has been ongoing since 2014 and continues to result in fatalities, deaths and bodily \\nbodily injuries, which by their nature and gravity are inherently irreparable.  There is \\nurgency in the situation, and the Court is to protect the vulnerable segments of the \\npopulation.  The fact that after the two Minsk Agreements (of 05.09.2014 and \\n12.02.2015) the situation remains unstable, and the tensions  and indiscriminate \\nshelling (from all sides) are still ongoing, stresses the ICJ’ s duty to order provisional \\nmeasures of protection. \\n For its part, the CERD  Convention is a core U.N. human rights Convention \\nintended to protect righ ts of the human person a t intra -State level.   Accordingly, \\nconcern for the protection of vulnerable segments of the population must inform the \\nCourt’s finding that the test of human vulnerability here applies, requiring provisional \\nmeasures of protection.  To this end, there is prima facie jurisdiction under the CERD \\nConvention ( inter alia  Articles 2 (1) and 5  (b)), as well as under the ICSFT \\nConvention (Article 18, as related to Article 2), and undue and groundless obstacles to \\naccess to justice thereunder are to be discarded” (paras. 47-48, and cf. para. 49). \\n 12. Judge Cançado Trindade adds that the application of International Humanitarian Law and \\nthat of the ICSFT and CERD Conventions “ are not mutually-excluding, but rather, they reinforce \\neach other in the factual context of the cas d’espèce, so as to secure the protection due to persons in \\nsituations of great vulnerability” (para.  50).  In his perception, t he circumstances of the  \\ncas d’espèce “call for a vue d’ensemble  of the relevant provisions of the ICSFT and CERD \\nConventions, and ILHR and IHL in the exercise of hermeneutics.  Other main organs of the United \\nNations (like the General Assembly and the Security Council) have likewise expressed their \\nconcerns with the circumstances of the cas d’espèce” (para. 51). \\n 13. Judge Cançado Trindade then observes that, as on previous occasions, it so happens that, \\nin face of the victimization of vulnerable segments of the population in an ongoing armed conflict \\nor hostilities, one can behold the “approximations and convergences” between, and the concomitant \\napplication of, International Humanitarian Law and other international Conventions (of human \\nrights and others), a situation, \\uf0be he adds, \\uf0be that  \\n“clearly requires the recognition of the effects of the Convention at issue vis-à-vis \\nothers, simples particuliers (Drittwirkung).  In the cas d’espèce, such is the case of the \\nICSFT and CERD Conventions:  Drittwirkung has as incidence here, as both \\nConventions cover inter -individual relations as well, without thereby excluding the \\ndetermination of State responsibility (even if by omission, a question for consideration \\nat the subsequent stage of the merits)” (para. 52). \\n 14. He further recalls, in a wider framework, that the cycle of World Conferences of the \\nUnited Nations (along the nineties and beginning of the last decade), came significantly to disclose \\na common denominator, underlying the final documents they adopted, namely, “the recognition of \\nthe legitimacy of the concern of the international community as a whole with the conditions of \\nliving of the population everywhere ” (para. 53).  The II UN World Conference of Human Rights \\n(Vienna, 1993), in particular, added an  important element to this common denominator, namely, \\nthe special attention devoted to the vulnerable segments  of the popu lation everywhere;  the \\nprotection of the vulnerable , in Judge  Cançado Trindade’s view, constitutes its great legacy \\n(para. 54).  The Declaration and Programme of Action of Vienna, final document adopted by the \\n1993 Vienna Conference, sought to concentrate  special attention on persons  suffering from \\ndiscrimination and vulnerable groups, in greater need of protection.  It much contributed to “the \\nrecognition of the centrality of victims in the present domain of protection”, with special attention \\n 15. Part VIII of the present Separate Opinion is devoted to the protection, by means of \\nprovisional measures, of the fundamental  rights of the human person, beyond the strict inter -State \\ndimension (p aras. 56-61).  Judge Cançado Trindade ponders that the vulnerability of human \\nlife, \\uf0be which has attracted attention of philosophers along the centuries,  \\uf0be assumes a dramatic \\ndimension in face of persisting and chronic violence, and even of policies leading  to it.   \\nJudge Cançado Trindade ponders that “[h]umanist thinking has always stood against that, and in \\ndefence of human life, and dignified conditions of living” (para.  62), \\uf0be as exemplified by the \\nreflections of the universal writer L.  Tolstoi (paras.  62-67).  In situations of generalized \\nviolence, \\uf0be he proceeds, \\uf0be attention is to be focused on the affected human beings, well beyond a \\nstrictly inter-State outlook (paras. 68 and 71), so as “to protect human life”, pursuant to “a humanist \\noutlook” (para. 69);  provisional measures of protection are “truly tutelary” (para. 72), calling for “a \\nmore pro-active posture” on the part of the Court (para. 73). \\n 16. Judge Cançado Trindade then stresses that the autonomous legal regime of provisional \\nmeasures of protection  \\n“is configured by the rights to be protected (not necessarily identical to those \\nvindicated later in the merits stage), by the obligations emanating from the provisional \\nmeasures of protection, generating autonomously State responsibility, with its legal \\nconsequences, and by the presence of (potential) victims already at the stage of \\nprovisional measures of protection. \\n As the cas d’espèce  shows, the claimed rights to be protected encompass the \\nfundamental rights of human beings, such as the right to  life, the right to personal \\nsecurity and integrity, the right not to be forcefully displaced or evacuated from one’s \\nhome.  The duty of compliance with provisional measures of protection brings to the \\nfore another element configuring their autonomous lega l regime, ( . . .) in its \\ncomponent elements, namely:  non-compliance and the prompt engagement of State \\nresponsibility;  prompt determination by the Court of breaches of provisional \\nmeasures of protection; and the ensuing duty of reparation for damages res ulting from \\nthose breaches” (paras. 74-75, and cf. paras. 77-81). \\n 17. In this domain,  \\uf0be he continues, \\uf0be “international case-law seems to be preceding legal \\ndoctrine”, and this development portrays the relevance of the preventive dimension in \\ncontemporary international law;  contemporary international tribunals are to foster this progressive \\ndevelopment, “to the benefit of all the justiciables” (para.  82).  This is a matter which requires \\n“much reflection, from a humanist outlook ” (para. 84).  In the circum stances of the cas d’espèce, \\nthe decisive test, in his understanding, “is that of huma n vulnerability, rather than so -called \\n‘plausibility’ of rights” (para. 85).  And he adds that \\n “In face of the gravity of the situation, of urgency and risks of (further ) \\nirreparable damage, provisional measures of protection are required.  Their indication \\nis oriented by the principle pro persona humana , pro victima.  Those measures bear \\nwitness to the current historical process of humanization of international law, which is \\nirreversible.  The protection of human beings in situations of great vulnerability has \\nthus found expression at international law level in our times, as a sign of such \\n 18. In his u nderstanding, attention is to be concentrated on victims (including the potential \\nones), \\uf0be be they individuals 1, groups of individuals 2, peoples or humankind 3, as subjects of \\ninternational law,  \\uf0be and not on inter -State susceptibilities;   he stresses that “ [h]uman beings in \\nvulnerability are the ultimate beneficiaries of provisional measures of protection, endowed \\nnowadays with a truly tutelary character, as true jurisdictional guarantees of preventive character” \\n(para. 86). \\n 19. In the course of the proceed ings leading to the adoption of the present Order, the \\nsituation of utmost vulnerability of segments of the population  \\uf0be calling for provisional measures \\nof protection  \\uf0be was brought to the attention of the Court (part  III, supra, and para.  87) and \\nJudge Cançado Trindade finds, in conclusion, that it is  \\n“regrettable that such human vulnerability is not duly dealt with in the reasoning of the \\nCourt, nor expressly reflected in the dispositif of the present Order, where,  \\uf0be despite \\nthe constatation in that docu mentation of the situation of human vulnerability of \\nsegments of the population (e.g., under indiscriminate shelling),  \\uf0be the protection of \\nthe fundamental rights to life and to the security and integrity of the person is not even \\nmentioned. \\n Even so, point  (2) of the dispositif, addressed to both contending Parties, and \\nthe only one covering the dispute as a whole before the Court (encompassing both the \\nICSFT and the CERD Conventions), in both Crimea and eastern Ukraine, in my \\nunderstanding implicitly exten ds protection also to those fundamental rights, in \\nordering that ‘[b]oth Parties shall refrain from any action which might aggravate or \\nextend the dispute before the Court or make it more difficult to resolve’. \\n The principle of humanity comes to the fore.   There are no restrictions ratione \\npersonae (e.g., attempting to focus exclusively on relations between States and \\nindividuals).  International Conventions, like the two invoked in the present case (the \\nICSFT and the CERD Conventions), as I have already p ointed out, have a \\nDrittwirkung effect, they cover likewise inter -individual relations, without thereby \\nexcluding the subsequent consideration of State responsibility (as to the merits), even \\nif by omission. \\n After all, the principle of humanity permeates the whole corpus juris  of \\ncontemporary international law (encompassing the converging trends of the \\nInternational Law of Human Rights, International Humanitarian Law, International \\nLaw of Refugees, International Criminal Law).  The principle of humanity has a clear \\nincidence on the protection of persons in great vulnerability.   The raison d’humanité \\nprevails here over the raison d’État .  Human beings stand in need, ultimately, of \\nprotection against evil, which lies within themselves” (paras. 88-91). \\n                                                      \\n1As he pointed out in his s eparate opinions of t he A.S. Diallo case (Judgments of 30.11.2010, merits; and of \\n19.06.2012, reparations). \\n2As he sustained in his d issenting and separate opinions in the case of Questions Relating to the Obligation to \\nProsecute or Extradite  (Order of 28.05.2009, and Judgment  of 20.07.2012, respectively), as well as in his dissenting \\nopinion in the case of the Application of the Convention against Genocide (Judgment of 03.02.2015). \\n3As he upheld in his three recent dissenting opinions in the three cases of the Obligations of N uclear \\nSeparate opinion of Judge Bhandari \\n Judge Bhandari is in agreement with the Court’s Order to indicate provisional measures in \\nrespect of the International Convention on the Suppression of All Forms of Racial Discrimination \\n(CERD).  However, he feels  compelled to write a separate opinion in order to clarify his views \\nconcerning the Court’s decision not to indicate provisional measures in relation to the International \\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (ICSFT).  In the facts and \\ncircumstances of the case, on the preliminary examination of the evidence provided by both Parties, \\nJudge Bhandari is  of the view  that the Court ought to have indicated provisional measures in \\nrelation to the ICSFT. \\n In his opinion, Judge  Bhandari deals both with the  breaches of the ICSFT  as alleged by \\nUkraine, and with the response of the Russian Federation, in order to ascertain whether a case has \\nbeen made out for the indication of provisional measures. \\n In his opinion, Judge Bhandari examines each requirement for the indication of provisional \\nmeasures in turn.  First, he discusses prima facie jurisdiction.  Second, he examines plausibility, \\nwith specific reference to whether the acts alleged by Ukraine fall within the scope of Article 2 of \\nthe ICSFT.  Third, he turns to the existence of a real and imminent risk of irreparable prejudice.  \\nFourth, he examines the presence of a link between the rights invoked by Ukraine and the \\nprovisional measures it requested.  Since both Parties adduced extensive evidence to the Cou rt in \\norder to show that the requirements for the indication of provisiona l measures were or were not \\nmet, Judge Bhandari preliminarily examines such evidence in order to subsequently appraise it  in \\naccordance with the test laid down in the Court’s jurisprudence for indicating provisional measures. \\n Concerning prima facie  jurisdiction, Judge  Bhandari is of the view that Ukraine adduced \\nsufficient evidence to show that the requirements contained in the compromissory clause under \\nArticle 24 of the ICSFT are m et.  First, Ukraine demonstrated that a dispute prima facie  exists \\nbetween the Parties in relation to the ICSFT, by submitting numerous Notes Verbales showing the \\nopposing views of the Parties concerning the Russian Federation’s obligations under the \\nConvention.  Second, Ukraine showed that four rounds of negotiation were held between the \\nParties with respect to the ICSFT prior to filing the case with the Court.  Third, Ukraine also \\nshowed that it sent a request for arbitration to the Russian Federation pri or to filing the case with \\nthe Court.  Accordingly, Judge Bhandari concludes that prima facie jurisdiction exists in respect of \\nthe ICSFT. \\n Concerning plausibility, Judge  Bhandari agrees with the Court that  the obligation under \\nArticle 18 of the ICSFT  to co-operate to prevent terrorism financing only arises if the acts alleged \\nby Ukraine plausibly fall within the scope of Article 2 of the ICSFT .  Therefore, Judge Bhandari \\nanalyses the evidence adduced by both Parties with respect to the elements of the defi nition of \\nterrorism under Article 2 of the ICSFT.  Judge Bhandari is of the opinion that the evidence adduced \\nby Ukraine is not effectively countered by the evidence submitted by the Russian Federation.  \\nAccording to him, the evidence shows that it is plausible that there has been a transfer of “funds” to \\narmed groups in eastern Ukraine, and that such “funds” have been plausibly transferred with \\n“intent or knowledge” that they would be used or were to be used to commit one of the offences \\nunder Article 2, paragraph 1 (b), of the ICSFT.  Moreover, Judge Bhandari is of the opinion that the \\nnumerous events in eastern Ukraine resulting in the loss of human lives show that there plausibly \\nexists a pattern of targeting civilians and persons not taking direct part in hostilities, which also \\nshows that the acts alleged by Ukraine were plausibly committed with the purpose of intimidating \\nthe population.  Judge  Bhandari is of the view that Ukraine adduced sufficient evidence to show \\nthat the rights whose protection it invoked at this stage in the proceedings are plausible.  \\n Concerning the real and imminent risk of irreparable prejudice, Judge  Bhandari is of the \\nview that the continuous loss of human life in eastern Ukraine would make it impossible to restore \\nthat the recent escalation of violence in eastern Ukraine, especially in Avdiivka, justifies a finding \\nthat the situation is urgent.  Judge  Bhandari also maintains that the provisional measures requested \\nby Ukraine are linked to the rights whose protection it sought, and could therefore have been \\nindicated by the Court. \\n Judge Bhandari concludes that, based on a preliminary examination of the evidence \\nsubmitted by both Parties, the Court ought to have indicated provisional measures in relation to the \\nICSFT. \\nDeclaration of Judge Crawford \\n Judge Crawford explained why the rights that the Court sought to protect by making a \\nprovisional measures order in relation to repres entative institutions of the Crimean Tatars, \\nincluding the Mejlis, are plausible.  He briefly described the modern history of the Sürgün, the \\ncollective expulsion of the Tatars from Crimea which was in effect from 1944 to 1989.  He set out \\nthe key constitu tional features of the main representative bodies of the Crimean Tatars, the \\nQurultay and the Mejlis, noting that the Mejlis have a particular representative role.  The definition \\nof racial discrimination may be met by a restriction that directly implicates a racial or ethnic group, \\neven if it is not expressly based on those grounds.  He noted that the banning  of the Mejlis needed \\nto be carefully justified given the historical persecution of the Crimean Tatars and the role of the \\nMejlis in advancing and protecting the rights of the people it represents at a time of disruption and \\nchange.  At this stage, there was sufficient evidence to conclude that the measure in question \\nplausibly affects rights under CERD.  \\nSeparate opinion of Judge ad hoc Pocar \\n Judge ad hoc Pocar has voted with the majority in favour of the indication of all provisional \\nmeasures concerning the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \\nDiscrimination (CERD), as well as of the provisional measure asking both Partie s to refrain from \\nany action which might aggravate or extend the dispute. \\n However, he cannot share the view that the required threshold of plausibility is not met for \\nthe indication of at least some of the provisional measures requested by Ukraine with respect to the \\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (ICSFT).  In his view, \\nit is plausible that the indiscriminate attacks alleged by Ukraine are intended to spread terror, and \\nthat the persons providing funds to those w ho conducted these attacks had knowledge that such \\nfunds were to be used for that purpose.  He would therefore have favoured the indication of a \\nprovisional measure requesting the Russian Federation to provide Ukraine with the full \\nco-operation required by Article 18 of the ICSFT, including by exercising appropriate control over \\nits borders, in order to prevent any offences within the meaning of that convention from being \\ncommitted. \\n Moreover, Judge ad hoc Pocar has concerns regarding the implications of th e present Order \\nfor the good administration of justice.  He wonders how parties, in the future, will, in light of the \\nCourt’s decision, reconcile the need to provide sufficient evidence to prove their case on \\nplausibility and Practice Direction  XI.  In his  view, the risk that parties over -address the merits \\ncould also overburden the Court and endanger its ability to promptly indicate provisional measures. \\n Finally, Judge ad hoc Pocar wishes to further clarify why the shooting -down of flight MH17 \\nwas not exa mined in detail by the Court.  He recalls that the case under the ICSFT refers to both \\nthe shooting-down of flight MH17 and indiscriminate shelling on the ground, which may fall under \\nArticle 2, paragraph  1, letters (a) and (b) respectively.  To avoid any misunderstanding, he \\ndue to lack of urgency  \\uf0be the airspace over eastern Ukraine being closed  since July  2014 \\uf0be \\nexamine the applicability of letter (a), and hence of the Montreal Convention, to the shooting-down \\nof flight MH17. \\nSeparate opinion of Judge ad hoc Skotnikov \\n 1. Judge ad hoc Skotnikov concurs with the Court’s conclusion that the conditions required \\nby its Statute for the indication of provisiona l measures in respect of the rights alleged by Ukraine \\nunder the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism are not met \\nand supports the Court’s decision not to indicate provisional measures on the basis of that \\nConvention.  \\n 2. He explains that the right which Ukraine seeks to protect with respect to the Mejlis does \\nnot fall within the scope of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial \\nDiscrimination.  In his view , the measure contained in paragr aph 1 (a) of the operative clause may \\nbe seen as prejudging the merits.  For these reasons, he voted against it.  \\n 3. As to the second provisional measure, which requests Russia to ensure the availability of \\neducation in the Ukrainian language, Judge ad hoc Skotnikov does not think that in this case the \\nconditions of irrepa rable harm and urgency are met.  However, he felt compelled to support this \\nmeasure of general and non-controversial nature. \\n \\n___________ \\nINTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE \\nPeace Palace, Carnegieplein 2, 2517 KJ  The Hague, Netherlands \\nTel.:  +31 (0)70 302 2323   Fax:  +31 (0)70 364 9928 \\nWebsite: www.icj-cij.org   Twitter Account: @CIJ_ICJ   YouTube Channel: CIJ ICJ \\nLinkedIn page: International Court of Justice (ICJ) \\n Summary \\nNot an official document \\n \\n \\n \\n Summary 2019/5 \\n 8 November 2019 \\n \\n \\n \\nApplication of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of \\nTerrorism and of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms  \\nof Racial Discrimination (Ukraine v. Russian Federation) \\n \\nSummary of the Judgment of 8 November 2019 \\nI. HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS (PARAS. 1-22) \\n The Court begins by recalling that , on 16 January 2017, Ukraine filed in the Registry of the \\nCourt an Application instituting proceedings against the Russian Federat ion with regard to alleged \\nviolations by the latter of its obligations under the International Convention for the Suppression of \\nthe Financing of Terrorism of 9 December 1999 (the “ICSFT”) and the International Convention on \\nthe Elimination of All Forms of  Racial Discriminat ion of 21  December 1965 (“CERD”).  In its \\nApplication, Ukraine seeks to found the Court’s jurisdiction on Article  24, paragraph  1, of \\nthe ICSFT and on Article 22 of CERD, on the basis of Article 36, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the \\nCourt. \\n The Court goes on to recall  that, following the filing of a Request for the indication of \\nprovisional measures by Ukraine on the same day , by an Order of 19  April 2017, it indicated the \\nfollowing provisional measures:  \\n “(1) With regard to the situatio n in Crimea, the Russian Federation must, in \\naccordance with its obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination \\nof All Forms of Racial Discrimination,  (a) Refrain from maintaining or imposing \\nlimitations on the ability of the Crimean Tat ar community to conserve its \\nrepresentative institutions, including the Mejlis; (b) Ensure the availability of \\neducation in the Ukrainian language;  (2) Both Parties shall refrain from any action \\nwhich might aggravate or extend the dispute before the Court or make it more difficult \\nto resolve.” \\n Finally, the Court recalls that, o n 12  September 2018 , the Russian  Federation raised \\nII. INTRODUCTION (PARAS. 23-37) \\nA. Subject-matter of the dispute (paras. 23-32) \\n The Court explains that t he present proceedings were instituted by Ukraine following the \\nevents which occurred in eastern Ukraine and in Crimea from the spring of 2014 . With regard to \\nthe events in eastern Uk raine, the Applicant has brought proceedings only under the  ICSFT. With \\nregard to the situation in Crimea, Ukraine’s claims are based solely upon CERD.  The Court \\nobserves that the Parties have expressed divergent views as to the subject-matter of the dispu te \\nbrought by Ukraine before it. \\n The Court notes that one aspect of the subject-matter of the dispute is whether the Russian \\nFederation had the obligation, under the  ICSFT, to take measures and to co -operate in the \\nprevention and suppression of the allege d financing of terrorism in the context of events in eastern \\nUkraine and, if so, whether the Russian Federation breached such an obligation. The other aspect of \\nthe subject-matter of the dispute is whether the Russian Federation breached its obligations un der \\nCERD through disc riminatory measures allegedly taken against the Crimean Tatar and U krainian \\ncommunities in Crimea. \\nB. Bases of jurisdiction invoked by Ukraine (paras. 33-37) \\n The Court recalls that its jurisdiction is based on the consent of the parti es and is confined to \\nthe extent accepted by them. To establish the Court’s jurisdiction in the present case, Ukraine \\ninvokes Article  24, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT and Article  22 of CERD. The first of these \\nprovisions reads as follows: \\n “Any dispute betwee n two or more States Parties concerning the interpretation \\nor application of this Convention which cannot be settled through negotiation within a \\nreasonable time shall, at the request of one of them, be submitted  to arbitration. If, \\nwithin six months from the date of the request for arbitration, the parties are unable to \\nagree on the organization of the arbitration, any one of those parties may refer the \\ndispute to the International Court of Justice, by application, in conformity with the \\nStatute of the Court.” \\nArticle 22 of CERD provides that:  \\n “Any dispute between  two or more States Parties with respect to the \\ninterpretation or application of this Convention, which is not settled by negotiation or \\nby the procedures expressly provided for in this Conventio n, shall, at the request of \\nany of the parties to the dispute, be referred to the International Court of Justice for \\ndecision, unless the disputants agree to another mode of settlement.” \\n The Court observes that t he Russian Federation contests its jurisdiction to entertain the \\ndispute, arguing in this regard that it is not one which the Court has jurisdiction ratione materiae to \\nentertain, either under Article 24, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT or under Article 22 of CERD, and that \\nthe procedural preconditions s et out in these provisions were not met by Ukraine before it seised \\nthe Court. The Respondent further contends that Ukraine’s claims under CERD are inadmissible, \\nsince, in its view, available local remedies had not been exhausted before Ukraine  filed its \\nIII. THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THE  \\nFINANCING OF TERRORISM (PARAS. 38-77) \\n The Court begins by examining whether it has jurisdiction ratione materiae under Article 24, \\nparagraph 1, of the ICSFT and whether the procedural preconditions set forth in that provision have \\nbeen met. \\nA. Jurisdiction ratione materiae under the ICSFT (paras. 39-64) \\n The Court recalls that, in order to determine the Court’s jurisdiction ratione materiae under a \\ncompromissory clause concerning disputes relating to the interpretation or application of a treaty, it \\nis necessary to ascertain whether the acts of  which the applicant complains “fall within the \\nprovisions” of the treaty containing the clause. This may require the interpretation of the provisions \\nthat define the scope of the treaty . In the present case, the ICFT has to be interpreted  according to \\nthe rules contained in Articles 31 to 33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May \\n1969, to which both Ukraine and the Russian Federation are parties as of 1986. \\n The Court states that, a t the present stage of the proceedings, an examination by it of the \\nalleged wrongful acts or of the plausibility of the claims is not generally warranted. Its task is to \\nconsider the q uestions of law and fact that are relevant to the objection to its jurisdiction.  It \\nobserves that the ICSFT imposes obligations on States parties with respect to offen ces committed \\nby a person when “that person by any means, directly or indirectly, unlawfu lly and wilfully, \\nprovides or collects funds with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they \\nare to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out” acts of terrorism as described in Article  2, \\nparagraph 1 (a) and (b). As state d in the preamble, the purpose  of the Convention is to adopt \\n“effective measures for the prevention of the financing of terrorism, as well as for its suppression \\nthrough the prosecution and punishment of its perpetrators”. The ICSFT addresses offences \\ncommitted by indi viduals. In particular, Article  4 requires each State party to the Convention to \\nestablish the offences set forth in Article 2 as criminal offences under its domestic law and to make \\nthose offences punishable by appropriate penalties. The fina ncing by a State of acts of terrorism is \\nnot addressed by the ICSFT. However, it has never been contested that if a State commits a breach \\nof its obligations under the ICSFT, its responsibility would be engaged.  The Court adds that the \\nconclusion that the financing by a State of acts of terroris m lies outside the scope of the  ICSFT \\ndoes not mean that it is lawful under international law. It recalls that, in resolution 1373 (2001), the \\nUnited Nations Security Council, acting under Chapter  VII of the Charter,  decided that all States \\nshall “[r]efrain from providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities  or persons \\ninvolved in terrorist acts”. \\n The Court notes that, w hen defining the perpetrators of offences of financing  acts of \\nterrorism, Article 2 of the ICSFT refers to “any person”. According to its ordinary meaning, this \\nterm covers individuals comprehensively . The Convention  applies both to persons who are acting \\nin a private capacity and to those who are S tate agents. As the Court noted , State financing of acts \\nof terrorism is outside the scope of the ICSFT; therefore, the commission by a State official of an \\noffence described in Article  2 does not in itself  engage the responsibility of the State concerned  \\nunder the Convention. However, all Stat es parties to the ICSFT are under an obligation to take  \\nappropriate measures and to co -operate in the prevention and suppression of offences of financing \\nacts of terrorism committed by whichever person. Should a State breach such an obligation, its \\nresponsibility under the Convention would arise. \\n The Cour t observes that, a s the title of the ICSFT indicates, the Convention specifically \\nconcerns the support given to acts of terrorism by financing them. Article  2, paragraph 1, refers to \\nthe provision or colle ction of “funds”. It notes that s ince no specific objection to the Court’s \\njurisdiction was made by the Russian Federation with regard t o the scope of the term “funds” , this \\nproceedings. The Court adds that a n element of an offence under Article  2, paragraph  1, of \\nthe ICSFT is that the perso n concerned has provided funds “with the intention that they should be \\nused or in the knowledge that they are to be used” to comm it an act of terrorism. The existence of \\nthe requisite intention or knowledge raises complex issues of law and especially of fact that divide \\nthe Parties and are properly a matter for the merits. The same may be said of the question whether a \\nspecific act falls within the meaning of Article  2, paragraph 1 (a) or (b). This question is largely of \\na factual nature and is properly a matter for the merits of the case. The Court considers that, within \\nthe framework of the ICSFT, questions concerning the existence  of the requisite mental elements \\ndo not affect the scope of the Convention and therefore are not relevant to the Court’s  jurisdiction \\nratione materiae. \\n In light of the above, the Court concludes that the objection raised by the Russian Federation \\nto its jurisdiction ratione materiae under the ICSFT cannot be upheld. \\nB. Procedural preconditions under Article 24 of the ICSFT (paras. 65-77) \\n The Court must then ascertain whether the procedural pre conditions set forth in Article  24, \\nparagraph 1, of the ICSFT h ave been fulfilled. In this context, it examines whether the dispute \\nbetween the Parties could not be settled through negotiation within a reasonable time and, if so, \\nwhether the Parties were unable to agree on the organization of an arbitration within six  months \\nfrom the date of the request for arbitration. \\n1. Whether the dispute between the Parties could not be settled through negotiation  \\n(paras. 66-70) \\n The Court considers that Article 24, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT requires, as a first procedural \\nprecondition to the Court’s jurisdiction, that a State make a genuine attempt to settle through \\nnegotiation the dispute in question with the other State concerned. According to the same \\nprovision, the precondition of negot iation is met when the dispute “cannot be  settled through \\nnegotiation within a reasonable time”. As has previously been observed, “the subject-matter of the \\nnegotiations must relate to the subject -matter of the dispute which, in turn, must concern the \\nsubstantive obligations contained in the treaty in question”. \\n The Court recalls that, on 28  July 2014, Ukraine wrote a Note Verbale to the Russian \\nFederation, stating that  \\n“under the provisions of the 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the \\nFinancing of Terrorism, the Russian Party  is under an obligation to take such \\nmeasures, which may be necessary under its domestic law to investigate the facts \\ncontained in the information submitted by the Ukrainian Party, as well as to prosecute \\npersons involved in financing of terrorism”,  \\nand p roposing “to conduct negotiations on the issue of interpretation and app lication of \\nthe [ICSFT]”. On 15  August 2014, the Russian Fede ration informed Ukraine of its “readiness to \\nconduct negotiations on the issue of interpretation and application of the [IC SFT]”. While \\nexchanges of Notes and meetings between the Parties did not always focus on the interpretation or \\napplication of the ICSFT, negotiations over Ukraine’s claims relating to this Convention were a \\nsubstantial part. In particular, in a Note Verbale of 24 September 2014, Ukraine contended that  \\n“the Russian Side illegally, directly and indirectly, intentionally transfers military \\nequipment, provides the funds for terrorists training on its territory, gives them \\nmaterial support and send[s] them to t he territory of Ukraine for participation in the \\nOn 24 November 2014, the Russian Federation contested that the acts alleged by Ukraine could \\nconstitute violations of the ICSFT, but accepted that the agend a for bilateral consultations include \\nthe “international legal basis for suppression of financing of terrorism as applicable to the \\nRussian-Ukrainian relations”. After that Note, several others followed; moreover, four meetings \\nwere held in Minsk, the last one on 17 March 2016. Little progress was made by the Parties during \\ntheir negotiations. The Court therefore concludes that the dispute could not be settled through \\nnegotiation in what has to be regarded as a reasonable time and that the first preconditio n is \\naccordingly met. \\n2. Whether the Parties were unable to agree on the organization of an arbitration  \\n(paras. 71-77) \\n The Court recalls that, nearly two years after the start of negotiations between the Parties \\nover the dispute, Ukraine sent a Note Verba le on 19  April 2016, in which it stat ed that those \\nnegotiations had “failed” and that, “pursuant to Article 24, paragraph 1 of the Financing Terrorism \\nConvention, [it] request[ed] the Russian Federation to submit the dispute to arbitration under terms \\nto be agreed by mutual consent”. Negotiations concerning the organization of the arbitration were \\nsubsequently held until a period of six  months expired. During these negotiations, Ukraine also \\nsuggested to refer the dispute to a procedure other than arbitrati on, namely the submission of the \\ndispute to a chamber of the Court. In any event, the Parties were unable to agree on the \\norganization of the arbitration during the requisite period. The second  precondition stated in \\nArticle 24, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT must thus be regarded as fulfilled. \\n The Court therefore considers that the procedural pre conditions set forth in Article  24, \\nparagraph 1, of the ICSFT were met. The Court thus has jurisdiction to entertain the claims made \\npursuant to that provision. \\nIII. THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS  \\nOF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION (PARAS. 78-133) \\n The Court then examines the Russian Federation’s preliminary objections to the Court’s \\njurisdiction and the admissibility of Ukraine’s claims under CERD.  It recalls that  the Russian \\nFederation argues that the Court lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae under CERD, and that the \\nprocedural preconditions to the Court’s jurisdiction set out in Article  22 of the Convention are not \\nmet; the Russian Federation  also argues that Ukraine’s Application with regard to claims under \\nCERD is inadmissible because local remedies had not been exhausted before the dispute was \\nreferred to the Court. The Court deals with each objection in turn. \\nA. Jurisdiction ratione materiae under CERD (paras. 79-97) \\n The Court explains that, i n order to determine whether it has jurisdiction ratione materiae \\nunder CERD, it needs only to ascertain whether the measures of which Ukraine complains fall \\nwithin the provisions of the Convention. In this respect, the Court notes that both Parties agree that \\nCrimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians in Crimea constitute ethnic groups protected under CERD. \\nMoreover, Articles 2, 4, 5, 6 and  7 of the Convention set out specific obligations in relation to the \\ntreatment of individuals on the basis of “race, colour, descent, or nati onal or ethnic origin”. \\nArticle 2, paragraph 1, of CERD contains a general obligation to pursue by all appropriate means a \\npolicy of eliminating racial discrimination and an obligation to engage in no act or practice of racial \\ndiscrimination against persons, groups of persons or institutions. Article 5 imposes an obligation to \\nprohibit and eliminate racial discrimination and to guarantee the right of everyone to equality \\nbefore the law, not ably in the enjoyment of rights mentioned therein, including political, civil, \\n The Court, taking into account the broadly formulated rights and obligations contained in the \\nConvention, including the obligations under Article 2, paragraph 1, and the non -exhaustive list of \\nrights in Article  5, considers that the meas ures of which Ukraine complains  — restrictions \\nallegedly imposed on Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians in Crimea — are capable of having an \\nadverse effect on the enjoyment of certain rights protected under CERD. These measures thus fall \\nwithin the provisions of the Convention. \\n Consequently, the Court concludes that the claims of Ukrain e fall within the provisions \\nof CERD. \\nB. Procedural preconditions under Article 22 of CERD (paras. 98-121) \\n The Court turns to the examination of the procedu ral preconditions under Article  22 of the \\nConvention. \\n1. The alternative or cumulative character of the procedural preconditions (paras. 99-113) \\n Pursuant to Article  22 of CERD, the Court states that it has jurisdiction to decide a dispute \\nbrought under the Convention, provided that such a dispute is “not settled by negotiation or by the \\nprocedures expressly provided for in this Convention”. As the Court has previously found, “in their \\nordinary meaning, the terms of Article  22 of CERD  . . . establish preconditions to be fulfilled \\nbefore the seisin of the Court”. In order to determine whether these preconditions are alternative or \\ncumulative, the Court applies the rules of cus tomary international law on treaty interpretation as \\nreflected in Articles 31 to 33 of the Vienna Convention. \\n Concerning the text of Article  22 of CERD, the Court notes that the Parties expressed \\ndivergent views on the meaning of the word “or” in the phrase “not settled by negotiation or by the \\nprocedures expressly provided for in this Convention”. The Court notes that the conjunction “or” \\nappearing between “negotiation” and the “procedures expressly provided for in this Convention” is \\npart of a clause whi ch is introduced by the word “not”, and thus formulated in the negative. While \\nthe conjunction “or” should generally be interpreted disjunctiv ely if it app ears as part of an \\naffirmative clause, the same view cannot necessarily be taken when the same conjun ction is part of \\na negative clause. Article  22 is an example of the latter. It follows that, in the relevant part of \\nArticle 22 of CERD, the conjunction “or” may have either disjunctive or conjunctive meaning. The \\nCourt therefore is of the view that while the word “or” may be interpreted disjunctively and \\nenvisage alternative procedural preconditions, this is not the only possible interpretati on based on \\nthe text of Article 22. \\n Turning to the context of Article  22 of CERD, the Court notes that “negotiation” and the \\n“procedures expressly provided for in [the] Convention” are two means to achieve the same \\nobjective, namely to settle a dispute by agreement. Both of these conditions  rest on the States \\nparties’ willingness to seek an agreed settlement of their dispute. It follows that, should negotiation \\nand the CERD Committee procedure be considered cumulative, States would have to try to \\nnegotiate an agreed solution to their dispute and, after negotiation has not been successful, take th e \\nmatter before the CERD  Committee for further negotiation, again in order to reach an agreed \\nsolution. The Court consid ers that the context of Article  22 of CERD does not support this \\ninterpretation. In the view of the Court, the context of Article  22 rather indicates that it wo uld not \\nbe reasonable to require States parties which have already failed to reach an agreed settlement \\nthrough negotiations to engage in an additional set of negotiations. \\n The Court considers that Article  22 of CERD must also be interpreted in light of t he object \\nand purpose of the Convention. Article  2, paragraph  1, of CERD provides that States parties to \\nStates parties undertake to eradicate incitement to ra cial discrimination and to combat prejudices \\nleading to rac ial discrimination by adopting “immediate and positive measures” and “immediate \\nand effective measures” respectively. The preamble to CERD further emphasizes the States’ \\nresolve to adopt all measur es for eliminating racial discrimination “speedily”. The Court considers \\nthat these provisions show the States parties’ aim to eradicate all forms of racial discrimination \\neffectively and promptly. In the Court’s view, the achievement of such aims could be  rendered \\nmore difficult if the procedural preconditions under Article 22 were cumulative. \\n The Court concludes that Article  22 of CERD imposes alternative preconditions to the \\nCourt’s jurisdiction. Since the dispute between the Parties was not referred to  the CERD \\nCommittee, the Court will only examine whether the Parties attempted to negotiate a settlement to \\ntheir dispute. \\n2. Whether the Parties attempted to negotiate a settlement to their dispute under CERD  \\n(paras. 114-121) \\n The Court has already had th e opportunity to examine the notion  of “negotiation” under \\nArticle 22 of CERD. It has thus stated that  \\n“negotiations are distinct from mere protests or disputations. Negotiations entail more \\nthan the plain opposition of legal views or interests between tw o parties, or the \\nexistence of a series of accusations and rebuttals, or even the exchange of clai ms and \\ndirectly opposed counter -claims. As such, the concept of ‘negotiations’ differs from \\nthe concept of ‘dispute’, and requires — at the very least — a genuine attempt by one \\nof the disputing parties to engage in discussions with the other disputing party, with a \\nview to resolving the dispute.”  \\nThe Court has also stated that “evidence of such an attempt to negotiate  — or of the conduct of \\nnegotiations — does not require the reaching of an actual agreement between the disputing \\nparties”, and that “to meet the precondition of negotiation in the compromissory clause of a treaty, \\nthese negotiat ions must relate to the subject -matter of the treaty containing the c ompromissory \\nclause”. The Court has further held that “the precondition of negotiation is met only when there has \\nbeen a failure of negotiations, or when negotiations have become futile or deadlocked”. \\n The Court notes that Ukraine sent its first Note Verbale to the Russian Federation concerning \\nalleged violations of CERD on 23  September 2014. In that Note, Ukraine listed a number of \\nmeasures which, in its view, the Russian Federation was implementing in violation of the \\nConvention, and the rights which suc h acts were allegedly violating, and went on to state that “the \\nUkrainian Side offers to the Russian Side to negotiate the use of [CERD], in particular, the \\nimplementation of international legal liability in accordance with interna tional law”. On \\n16 October 2014, the Russian Federation communicated to Ukraine its willingness to hold \\nnegotiations on the interpretation  and application of CERD. On 29  October 2014, the Applicant \\nsent a second Note Verbale to the Respondent, asking for f ace-to-face negotiations which it \\nproposed to hold on 21  November 2014. The Russian Federa tion replied to this Note on \\n27 November 2014, after Ukraine’s proposed date for the meeting had passed. Ukraine sent a third \\nNote Verbale on 15  December 2014, proposing negotiations on 23  January 2015. The Russian \\nFederation replied to this Note on 11  March 2015, after the date proposed by Ukraine for the \\nnegotiations had passed. Eventually, the Parties held three rounds of neg otiation in Minsk between \\nApril 2015 and December 2016. \\n There are specific references to CERD in the Notes Verbales exchanged between the Parties, \\nwhich also refer to the rights and obligations arising under that Convention. In those Notes, \\nUkraine set out its views concerning the alleged violations of the Convention, a nd the Russian \\nthat the subject-matter of such diplomatic e xchanges related to the subject -matter of the dispute \\ncurrently before the Court. \\n The Court obser ves that the negotiations between the Parti es lasted for approximately \\ntwo years and included both dip lomatic correspondence and face -to-face meetings, which, in the \\nCourt’s view, and despite the lack of success in reaching a negotiated solution, indicates  that a \\ngenuine attempt at negotiation was made by Ukraine. Furthermore, the Court is of the opinion that, \\nduring their diplomatic exchanges, the Parties’ respective positions remained substantially the \\nsame. The Court thus concludes that the negotiations between the Parties had become futile or \\ndeadlocked by the time Ukraine filed its Application under Article 22 of CERD. \\n Accordingly, the Court concludes that the procedural preconditions for it to have jurisdiction \\nunder Article  22 of CERD are satisfied i n the circumstances of the  present case. As a result, \\nthe Court has jurisdiction to consider the claims of Ukraine under CERD. \\nC. Admissibility (paras. 122-132) \\n Lastly, the Court turns to the objection raised by the Russian  Federation to the admissibility \\nof Ukraine’s Application with regard to claims under CERD on the ground that Ukraine did not \\nestablish that local remedies had been exhausted before it seised the Court. \\n The Court recalls that local remedies must be previously exhausted as a matter of cu stomary \\ninternational law in cases in which a State brings a claim on behalf of one or more of its nationals. \\n The Court notes that, according to Ukraine, the Russian Federation has engaged in a \\nsustained campaign of racial discrimination, carried out thro ugh acts repeated over an appreci able \\nperiod of time starting in  2014, against the Crimean Tatar and Ukrainian communities in Crimea. \\nThe Court also notes that the individual instances to which Ukraine refers in its submissions \\nemerge as illustrations of t he acts by which the Russian Federation has allegedly engaged in a \\ncampaign of racial discrimination. It follows, in the view of the Court, that, in filing its Application \\nunder Article 22 of CERD, Ukraine does not adopt the cause of one or more of its nat ionals, but \\nchallenges, on the basis of CERD, the alleged pattern of conduct of the Russian Federation with \\nregard to the treatment of the Crimean Tatar and Ukrainian communities in Crimea. In view of the \\nabove, the Court concludes that the rule of exhaust ion of local remedies does not apply in the \\ncircumstances of the present case. This conclusion by the Court is without prejudice to the question \\nof whether the Russian Federation has actually engaged in the campaign of racial discrimination \\nalleged by Ukraine, thus breaching its obligations under CERD. This is a question which the Court \\nwill address at the merits stage of the proceedings. \\n The Court finds that the Russian Federation’s objection to the admissibility of Ukraine’s \\nApplication with regard to CERD must be rejected. \\n* \\n The Court considers that i t follows from the findings made above that the \\nRussian Federation’s objections to the jurisdiction of the Court under Article  22 of CERD and to \\nthe admissibility of Ukraine’s Application with regard to CERD must be rejected. Accordingly, the \\nCourt concludes that it has jurisdiction to entertain the claims made by Ukraine under CERD and \\nIV. OPERATIVE CLAUSE (PARA. 134) \\n For these reasons,  \\n THE COURT, \\n (1) By thirteen votes to three, \\n Rejects the preliminary objection raised by the Russian  Federation that the Court lacks \\njurisdiction on the basis of Article  24, paragraph  1, of the International Convention for the \\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism; \\nIN FAVOUR : President Yusuf; Judges Abraham, Bennouna, Cançado  Trindade, Donoghue, \\nGaja, Sebutinde, Bhandari, Robinson, Crawford, Salam, Iwasawa; Judge ad hoc Pocar; \\nAGAINST: Vice-President Xue; Judge Tomka; Judge ad hoc Skotnikov; \\n (2) By thirteen votes to three, \\n Finds that it has jurisdiction on the basis of Article  24, paragraph  1, of the International \\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, to entertain the claims made by \\nUkraine under this Convention;  \\nIN FAVOUR : President Yusuf; Judges Abraham, Bennouna, Cançado  Trindade, Donoghue, \\nGaja, Sebutinde, Bhandari, Robinson, Crawford, Salam, Iwasawa; Judge ad hoc Pocar; \\nAGAINST: Vice-President Xue; Judge Tomka; Judge ad hoc Skotnikov; \\n (3) By fifteen votes to one, \\n Rejects the preliminary objection raised by the Russian  Federation that the Court lacks \\njurisdiction on the basis of Article  22 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All \\nForms of Racial Discrimination;  \\nIN FAVOUR : President Yusuf; Vice-President Xue; Judges Tomka, Abraham, Bennouna, \\nCançado Trindade, Donoghue, Gaja, Sebutinde, Bhandari, Robinson, Crawford, Salam, \\nIwasawa; Judge ad hoc Pocar; \\nAGAINST: Judge ad hoc Skotnikov; \\n (4) Unanimously, \\n Rejects the preliminary objection raised by the Russian Federation to the admissibility of the \\nApplication of Ukraine in relation to the claims under the International Convention on the \\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination;  \\n (5) By fifteen votes to one, \\n Finds that it has jurisdiction, on the basis of Article 22 of the International Convention on the \\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, to entertain the claims made by Ukraine under \\nIN FAVOUR : President Yusuf; Vice-President Xue; Judges Tomka, Abraham, Bennouna, \\nCançado Trindade, Donoghue, Gaja, Sebutinde, Bhandari, Robinson, Crawford, Salam, \\nIwasawa; Judge ad hoc Pocar; \\nAGAINST: Judge ad hoc Skotnikov. \\n \\n \\n Vice-President XUE appends a dissenti ng opinion to th e Judgment of the Court; \\nJudges TOMKA and CANÇADO TRINDADE append separate opinions to th e Judgment of the Court; \\nJudges DONOGHUE and ROBINSON append declaratio ns to the Judgment of the Court ; \\nJudge ad hoc POCAR appends a separate opini on t o the Judgment of the Court ; \\nJudge ad hoc SKOTNIKOV appends a dissenting opinion to the Judgment of the Court. \\n \\nDissenting opinion of Vice-President Xue \\n Vice-President Xue takes the view that the Court does not have jurisdiction under Article 24, \\nparagraph 1, of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism \\n(“ICFST”) in this case. \\n In her opinion, Ukraine’s claim as presented in its Application and Memorial concerns more  \\nthe alleged military and financial support provided by the Russian Federation  to the armed groups \\nin the course of armed conflict in eastern Ukraine, where violations of  international humanitarian \\nlaw may have occurred , than the Russian Federation’s failure in preventing and suppressing the \\nfinancing of terrorism. She considers that  the materials submitted by Ukraine do not present a \\nplausible case that falls within the scope of the ICFST.  \\n Vice-President Xue observes that identification of the subject -matter of the dispute is \\nessential for the Court to determine its jurisdiction ratione materiae. More often than not, a dispute \\narises from a complicated political context, where the legal question brought before the Court is \\nmixed with various political aspects. In her view, t hat fact alone does n ot preclude the Court from \\nfounding its jurisdiction. Recalling the Court’s pronouncement in the case concerning United States \\nDiplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran , she notes that w hat the Court had to take into account \\nwhen determining the question of jurisdiction was whether there was connection, legal or factual, \\nbetween the “overall problem” in the context and the particular events that gave rise to the dispute, \\nwhich precluded the separate examination of the applicant’s claims by the Court.   \\n Vice-President Xue considers that w hen the dispute constitutes an inseparable part of the \\noverall problem and any legal pronouncement by the Court on that particular dispute would \\nnecessarily step into the area beyond its jurisdiction, judicial prudence and self-restraint is required. \\nShe emphasizes that in the international judicial settlement of disputes between States, the question \\nof jurisdiction is just as important as merits. This policy is designed and reflected in each and every \\naspect of the jurisdictional system of the Court. \\n Vice-President Xue observes that a cts alleged by Ukraine all took place during the internal \\narmed conflict in eastern Ukraine.  To characterize military and financial support from Russia’s \\nside, by whomever possible, as terrorism f inancing, would inevitably bear the legal implication of \\ndefining the nature of the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine, which, in her view, extends well \\nbeyond the limit of the Court’s jurisdiction under the ICSFT. In other words, Ukraine’s allegations \\nagainst the Russian Federation under the ICSFT bear an inseparable connection with the overall \\nsituation of the on going armed conflict in eastern Ukraine. Factually, documents before the Court \\ndo not demonstrate that the alleged terrorism financing can be disc retely examined without passing \\na judgment on the overall situation of the armed conflict in the area; Ukraine’s claim under the \\nICSFT forms an integral part of the whole issue in eastern Ukraine. Judicially, the Court is not in a \\nposition to resolve the dispute as presented by Ukraine. \\n Vice-President Xue is also of the view that , in considering the scope of the ICSFT, the \\nmeaning given by the Court to the term “any person” in Article  2, paragraph  1, of the ICSFT  \\ncannot be sustained by the rules of State r esponsibility. In its Application, Ukraine requests the \\nCourt to adjudge and declare that \\n“the Russian Federation, through its State organs, State agents, and other persons and \\nentities exercising governmental authority, and through other agents acting on its \\ninstructions or under its direction and control , has violated its obligations under the \\nTerrorism Financing Convention by:   \\n(a) supplying funds, including in -kind contributions of weapons and training , to \\nDPR, the LPR, the  Kharkiv Partisans, and associated groups and individuals, in \\nviolation of Article 18” (emphasis added). \\nAlthough Ukraine subsequently deleted this subm ission in the Memorial, instead  accusing the \\nRussian Federation of allowing and encouraging its own officials to finance terrorism, the \\nsubstance of its claim under the ICSFT remains unchanged. In her opinion, this is apparently a case \\nconcerning the allegations of the financing by a State of terrorist acts,  which, as the Court stated in \\nthe Judgment, is explicitly precluded from the scope of the ICSFT. \\n Vice-President Xue considers that , in the present case, the question whether or not the \\nRussian Federation allowed or encouraged military and financial suppo rt to the armed groups in \\neastern Ukraine falls outside the scope of the Court’s jurisdiction under the ICSFT. Should the case \\nproceed to the merits phase, the Court may find itself in a position where it has to pronounce on the \\nabove question, which, in her view, may raise the issue of judicial propriety.  \\n Vice-President Xue emphasizes that j udicial policy requires the Court to avoid unnecessary \\nprolongation of the legal process if the case does not present itself as plausible. Proper \\nidentification of th e subject -matter of the dispute that falls within the scope of the jurisdiction \\nratione materiae of the Court is essential for the purposes of good administration of justice and \\njudicial economy. To allow this case to proceed to the merits phase, in her vi ew, would neither \\nserve the object and purpose of the ICSFT, nor contribute to the peace process in the region. \\nSeparate opinion of Judge Tomka \\n Judge Tomka does not agree with the Court’s conclusion that it has jurisdiction over \\nUkraine’s claims arising u nder the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing \\nof Terrorism (“ICSFT”). He recalls that the ICSFT is a criminal law convention, establishing \\nobligations for States in respect of the prevention and punishment of the financing of terrorism. The \\nfinancing by a State of alleged acts of “terrorism”, as the Court confirms, lies outside the scope of \\nthe Convention. Ukraine’s claims, however, relate to the provision of arms and weapons. He does \\nnot consider that the Court has ascertained whet her the acts alleged by Ukraine fall within the \\nscope of the ICSFT, in accordance with the approach taken in the Oil Platforms case. For example, \\nthe Court does not evaluate whether the alleged supply of weapons falls within the scope of the \\nword “funds” a s used by the ICSFT. In Judge  Tomka’s view, it does not, and the Court therefore \\nlacks jurisdiction over Ukraine’s claims. \\n Similarly, Judge  Tomka has doubts whether the Court has reasonably and sufficiently \\ndemonstrated that it has jurisdiction ratione materiae under the International Convention on the \\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (“the  CERD”), in view of the  fact that the \\nCourt’s discussion of the question comprises only three paragraphs of its Judgment. He considers \\nthat the Court sh ould have expressly considered each of the preliminary  objections of the \\nRussian Federation, for example whether , under the CERD, there is an absolute  right to education \\nin one’s native language. However, because certain of Ukraine’s claims do fall within the scope of \\nthe CERD, Judge  Tomka agrees that the Court does have jurisdiction ratione materiae over these \\nclaims. \\n Judge Tomka is not convinced by the Court’s treatment of the question of the procedural \\npreconditions for seising the Court contained in Ar ticle 22 of the CERD. He is of the view that the \\npreconditions are cumulative. Judge Tomka considers that, read together, the terms “not” and “or” \\nin the phrase “not settled by negotiation or by the procedures expressly provided for in this \\nConvention” log ically call for a cumulative reading. This is consistent with the context, which \\nrequires the conditions to be cumulative in order to preserve the effectiveness of the procedures \\nforeseen in Articles 11 to 13 of the CERD. He considers this interpretation t o be confirmed by the \\n Finally, Judge  Tomka considers that the Court has been needlessly imprecise in its \\ndescription of breaches. He recalls that, consistently with the language of Article  36, \\nparagraph 2 (c) of the Statute of the Court, the International Law Commission, in its work on \\nState responsibility, determined that the language “breach of an international obligation” most \\naccurately describes the subjective legal phenomenon which can give rise to a State’s \\nresponsibility. Judge Tomka observes that the Court could have been more precise in this regard, \\nrather than referring to breaches of a treaty or one of its provisions. \\nSeparate opinion of Judge Cançado Trindade \\n 1. In his separate opinion, composed of seven parts, J udge Cançado Trindade begins by \\nobserving that he has concurred with his vote to the adoption of the present Judgment, dismissing \\nall preliminary objections in the present case. He then explains that he has reached the same \\ndecision of the International Co urt of Justice (ICJ), but on the basis of a distinct reasoning in \\nrespect of the selected points, which, in his perception, require further attention on the part of the \\nCourt. He thus finds it necessary to present his own reasoning in the present separate opinion. \\n 2. He focuses his reasoning on the following points: (a) basis of jurisdiction: its importance \\nfor the protection of the vulnerable under United Nations human rights conventions; (b) the \\nrationale of the compromissory clause of the CERD  Convention (Article 22); (c) the rationale of \\nthe local remedies rule in the international safeguard of human rights: protection and redress, rather \\nthan exhaustion; (d) the relevance of jurisdiction in face of the need to secure protection to those in \\nsituations of vulnerability; and (e) concluding considerations, followed by an epilogue containing a \\nrecapitulation of all the points that he sustains in the present separate opinion. \\n 3. Judge  Cançado Trindade starts by outlining t he rationale of United Nations human rights \\nconventions, like CERD, with attention to focus on the relevance of the basis of jurisdiction for the \\nprotection of the vulnerable under human rights conventions. He adds that h uman rights \\nconventions, like CERD, go beyond the outdated inter-State outlook, ascribing a central position to \\nthe individual victims, rather than to their States. In doing so  \\uf0be he proceeds \\uf0be human rights \\nconventions, like CERD, are turned to securing the effective protection of the rights of the human \\nperson, in light of the principle pro persona humana, pro victima (paras. 4-7). \\n 4. In his perception, ha d the inter -State dimension not been surmounted, not much \\ndevelopment would have taken place in the present domain of protection. In \\nJudge Cançado Trindade’s understanding, the realization of justice, with the judicial recognition of \\nthe sufferings of the victims, is an imperative, and  careful account is to be taken of the needs of \\nprotection of persons in situations of vulnerability or defencelessness. He adds that the compromissory \\nclause of a victim -oriented human rights convention, like  CERD (Article 22), is related to the \\njusticiables’ right of access to justice; this requires a necessary humanist outlook, and not at all a \\nState-centric and voluntarist one (paras. 11-20). \\n 5. Judge  Cançado Trindade ponders that, in the consideration of utmost vulnerability or \\ndefencelessness of the human person, the principle of humanity comes to the fore, and assumes a clear \\nincidence in the protection of human beings in situations of the  kind. He adds that the principle of \\nhumanity, which has met with judicial recognition, permeates human rights conventions, like CERD, \\nand the whole corpus juris of protection of human beings. Judge Cançado Trindade stresses that the \\nprinciple of humanity is in line with the long -standing jusnaturalist thinking (recta ratio); g eneral \\nprinciples of law enshrine common and superior values, shared by the international community as a \\n 6. Reiterating the position that he sustained in his dissenting opinion in the earlier ICJ’s case \\nof Application of the CERD  Convention (2011), opposing Georgia to the Russian  Federation, \\nJudge Cançado Trindade stresses, in the cas d’espèce opposing Ukraine to the Russian  Federation, \\nthat Article 22 of the CERD  Convention in  his view does not establish “preconditions” to the \\nCourt’s jurisdiction (para.  27). In the present case, he adds, the ICJ does not sustain any of the \\npreliminary objections, and correctly dismisses them all (para. 28). \\n 7. The next point he makes is that the incidence of the local remedies rule in human rights \\nprotection is certainly distinct from its application in the practice of diplomatic protection of \\nnationals abroad, there being nothing to hinder the application of that rule with greater or lesser \\nrigour in such different domains (para.  31). Judge  Cançado Trindade points out that w e are here \\nbefore a law of protection (droit de protection), where the local remedies rule has a rationale entirely \\ndistinct from the one in diplomatic protection: the former stresses redress, the latter outlines exhaustion \\n(paras. 32-38). In his own words: \\n “The rationale of the local remedies rule in human rights protection discloses the \\noverriding importance of the element of redress, the provision of which being a matter of \\nordre public; what ultimately matters is the redress obtained for the wrongs complained \\nof, and not the mechanical exhaustion of local remedies. (…) \\n This law of protection of the rights of the human person, within the framework of \\nwhich international and domestic law appear in constant interaction, is inspired by \\ncommon superior values: this goes pari passu with an increasing emphasis on the State’s \\nduty to provide effective local remedies. (…)” (paras. 42-43). \\n 8. Human beings protected by human rights conventions, like CERD \\uf0be he proceeds \\uf0be are \\ntheir ultimate beneficiaries, even in an inter -State claim thereunder, as the present one. It is \\n“necessary to keep in mind that the fundamental rights of human beings stand well above the \\nStates, which were his torically created to secure those rights. After all, States exist for human \\nbeings, and not vice-versa” (para.  39). Judge Cançado Trindade then recalls that the prevalence of \\nhuman beings over States marked presence in the writings of the “founding fathers ” of the law of \\nnations (in the sixteenth-seventeenth centuries), already attentive to the need of redress for the harm \\ndone to the human person (paras. 40-41 and 60-61).  \\n 9. The next part of his separate opinion turns attention to the relevance of jurisdiction in face of \\nthe need to secure protection to those in situations of vulnerability. He warns that h uman beings \\nstand in need of protection against evil, they need protection ultimately against themselves. \\nFurthermore, they stand in need of protection against arbitrariness, hence the importance of the \\nimperative of access to justice lato sensu, the right to the Law  (le droit au Droit, el derecho al \\nDerecho), to secure the realization of justice also in situations of utmost human vulnerability \\n(paras. 45-51).  \\n 10. Judge Cançado Trindade adds that f undamental principles of law conform the substratum \\nof the jus necessarium (not a jus voluntarium) in the protection of human beings, expressing an idea of \\nobjective justice, in the line of jusnaturalist thinking. In his understanding, the basic foundations of the \\nlaw of nations emanate ultimately from the universal juridical conscience (para. 54). Human beings are \\nsubjects of the law of nations, and attention is to remain turned to the victimized persons, rather than to \\n 11. In his own writing, “the basic posture is principiste, without making undue concessions to \\nState voluntarism. The assertion of an objective law, beyond the ‘will’ of individual States, is, in my \\nperception, a r evival of jusnaturalist thinking” (para.  53). In Judge  Cançado Trindade’s \\nunderstanding, o vercoming the limitations of legal positivism, attention is to focus on the humane \\nends of States, emanating from recta ratio, as propounded by the jusnaturalist vision. Rights inherent to \\nthe human person are anterior and superior to the States. \\n 12. Moreover, t he concomitant expansion of international jurisdiction, responsibility, \\npersonality and capacity, rescues and enhances the position of the human person as subj ect of \\ninternational law (paras. 68 and 78). The principle of humanity counts on judicial recognition in a \\ncorpus juris gentium oriented towards the victims, in the line of jusnaturalist thinking. The \\nuniversal juridical conscience (recta ratio) necessarily prevails over the “will” of States, being the \\nultimate material source of the law of nations. \\n 13. Judge Cançado Trindade concludes that t he law of nations is thus endowed with \\nuniversality. A judicial decision under human rights conventions, like CERD, calls for a reasoning \\ngoing well beyond the strict inter-State dimension, with attention turned to victimized human beings, \\nin pursuance of a humanist outlook. And the prevalence of the universal juridical conscience as the \\nultimate material source of the law of nations points to  securing the realization of justice in any \\ncircumstances. \\nDeclaration of Judge Donoghue \\n Judge Donoghue submits a declaration in which she sets out the reasons for her agreement \\nwith the Court’s decision to reject the Respondent’s preliminary objections to the Court’s \\njurisdiction ratione materiae. \\nDeclaration of Judge Robinson \\n 1. In his declaration, Judge  Robinson commences by stating that, although he has voted in \\nfavour of the operative paragraphs of the Judgment, he wishes to c omment on two aspects. He \\naddresses State responsibility and the references to acts of terrorism in the Judgment.  \\n 2. In respect of State responsibility, he examines and comments on paragraph  59 of the \\nJudgment and observes that there is nothing in certai n sentences of this paragraph to support the \\nconclusion that State financing of terrorism is outside the scope of the International Convention for \\nthe Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (the “Convention”). He argues that the result is that \\nwhen the Judgment goes on in the seventh sentence of this paragraph to cite  the preparatory work \\nof the Convention as confirming its earlier conclusion, it is in reality seeking to confirm a finding \\nthat has no basis in an analysis of the text of the Convention.  \\n 3. Judge  Robinson notes that p reparatory work may be used to confirm the meaning  of a \\nterm that results from the application of the general rule of interpretation set out in Article 31 of the \\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the “VCLT”). He observes that \\uf0be since the relevant \\narea of enquiry is the meaning of the term “any person” and the Court had not at this stage of its \\nreasoning established the meaning of that term in accordance with the general rule of interpretation \\nin Article 31 of the VCLT  \\uf0be there is no basis for recourse to  the preparatory work to confirm the \\nCourt’s conclusion that State financing of acts of terrorism is outside the scope of the Convention. \\nscope of the Convention, the Court has not grappled with the real issue in the case, that is, the \\nmeaning of the term “any person” and the impact, if any, that the resolution of this question has on \\nthe general rule of attribution to State s of responsibility for the acts of their agents. One \\nconsequence of the Court’s approach is that it renders questionable the finding in paragraph 61 that \\n“the commission by a State official of an offence described in Article 2 does not in itself engage the \\nresponsibility of the State concerned under the Convention”. \\n 4. According to Judge Robinson, in adopting this line of reasoning, the Court appears to have \\nput the proverbial cart before the horse, given that at this stage of its reasoning, it had not ye t \\nconsidered the meaning of the term “any person” in Article  2. He argues that when the Court does \\nin fact analyse the meaning of that term, it correctly concludes that it covers both private \\nindividuals and State agents. Here the Court has interpreted the  term “any person” in accordance \\nwith its ordinary meaning in its context and in light of the object and purpose of the Convention. \\nBut, by that time, it had already concluded that State financing was outside the scope of the \\nConvention. By this approach t he Court foreclosed itself from considering the impact that its \\nconclusion that State agents are covered by the term “any person” has on its analysis of the \\nquestion whether or not States are also covered by the Convention. According to Judge  Robinson, \\nin other words, the determination that State financing was outside the scope of the Convention \\nshould not have been made without the Court profiting from an analysis of the meaning of the term \\n“any person”. Further, he notes that in any event the preparatory work of the Convention is far \\nfrom unequivocal in supporting the conclusion that State financing is outside the scope of the \\nConvention.  \\n 5. Judge Robinson concludes that the Court has had recourse to the preparatory work of the \\nConvention in circumstance s not permitted by the customary rules of interpretation reflected in \\nArticles 31 and 32 of the VCLT. Moreover, the Court has adopted a line of reasoning that does not \\nestablish that the financing by a State of acts constituting the offence under Article  2 is outside the \\nscope of the Convention.  \\n 6. Turning to the references to acts of terrorism in the Judgment, Judge  Robinson observes \\nthat the history of multilateral efforts to combat terrorism is marked by the failure to adopt any \\nglobal treaty on the question (a failure principally explained by the difficulty in reaching agreement \\non a definition of terrorism). He expresses the view that the failure to adopt a multilateral treaty on \\ninternational terrorism is mainly due to the difficulties that are encou ntered in defining that \\nphenomenon. On the one hand , there are States whose approach is to concentrate only on the \\nheinous nature of the acts which an international convention would proscribe. On the other hand , \\nthere are those countries which want to ensure that the underlying causes of terrorism would not be \\nignored in the adoption of any international instrument. According to Judge Robinson, in the view \\nof these countries , a definition of terrorism should exclude from its ambit measures adopted by \\npeoples in the struggle for national liberation, self -determination and independence. He notes that \\nin light of the failure to adopt a multilateral treaty that defines international terrorism , States have \\nconcluded a large number of treaties at the global level,  which take the simpler and less \\nproblematic approach of creating offences by identifying certain acts which are characterized as \\noffences. He observes that a ll of these treaties carefully avoid using the term “terrorism” in \\ndefining the acts constituting the offences they create and that an examination of the nine treaties in \\nthe Annex referred to in Article  2 (1) (a) of the Convention shows that none of them describe the \\nacts constituting the offence under the relevant treaty as terrorism. Rather, they, l ike the  \\nConvention, only prohibit specific acts. Significantly , even though the preamble of two of these \\nconventions contain references to terrorism, there is absent from their articles  \\uf0be including the \\narticle creating the offence  \\uf0be any reference to terror ism. According to Judge  Robinson, i n that \\nrespect the Convention is similar to those conventions in that there is a reference to terrorism in the \\ntreaties i n the Annex were concluded in the shadow cast by the failure of the international \\ncommunity to agree on a definition of international terrorism. As such, they isolate acts to be \\ncriminalized as offences. However , in view of the failure to reach agreement o n the definition of \\ninternational terrorism, they avoid characterizing these acts as terrorism. For example, the \\nConvention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft  (1970) criminalizes the act of \\nseizing an aircraft (commonly called hijacking) b ut does not characteri ze the unlawful seizure as \\nterrorism, even though in ordinary parlance it would be so described. In the same vein the \\n(1979) Convention against the Taking of Hostages only criminalizes the act of taking hostages and \\ndoes not characterize that act as terrorism, although in colloquial parlance it would be so described.  \\n 7. Judge Robinson argues that the legal history shows that it is no mere happenstance that the \\nConvention does not describe the offence in Article  2 as terrorism, even t hough its title and \\npreamble refer to the phenomenon of terrorism. If during the negotiations Article  2 had been \\nformulated to read “any person commits the offence of terrorism within the meaning of this \\nConvention . . .”, rather than “[a]ny person commits  an offence within the meaning of this \\nConvention”, the draft Convention would more than likely have met with serious objections from \\nseveral countries which would have wanted to carve out an exception in respect of peoples \\nstruggling for liberation, self -determination and independence. According to Judge  Robinson, it is \\nfor this reason that the Court’s finding in paragraph  63 is problematic. In that paragraph the Court \\nfinds that “[a]n element of an offence under Article  2, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT is tha t the person \\nconcerned has provided funds ‘with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that \\nthey are to be used’ to commit an act of terrorism”. In his view, it is problematic because nowhere \\nin any of the articles of the ICSFT and in particular, nowhere in Article 2 which creates the offence, \\nis there any reference to “an act of terrorism”. He observes that, of course it would be \\nunobjectionable if the Judgment did not use terrorism as a term of art referring to the offence under \\nArticle 2. But here the reference to an “element of the offence”, that is, “the intention” (the \\nmens rea) that is required by Article  2, paragraph 1, to establish the offence makes it abundantly \\nclear that by “an act of terrorism” what is meant is the offence es tablished by the Convention. He \\nnotes that the Court should have followed the approach it took in the same paragraph when it \\nreferred to “an act fall[ing] within the meaning of Article  2, paragraph  1 (a) or (b)”. He also \\nobserves that this comment applies to other parts  of the Judgment where “terrorism” is used as a \\nterm of art referring to the offence under Article  2. In any event , if the phrase “act of terrorism” \\nwere to be retained in paragraph 63, the more appropriate formulation would be an act of financing \\nterrorism. \\nSeparate opinion of Judge ad hoc Pocar \\n In agreement with the decision of the majority to reject the preliminary objections raised by \\nthe Russian Federation, Judge  ad hoc Pocar clarifies his position regarding the jurisdiction \\nratione materiae of the Court on three points.  \\n Firstly, Judge ad hoc Pocar agrees with the conclusion of the Court that the financing by a \\nState of an offence set forth under Article  2 of the ICSFT “lies outside the scope of the \\nConvention”; he adds that the obligat ion to criminalize this offence  in their legislation inevitably \\npresupposes that States accept not to engage themselves in such conduct. He also notes that even if \\nthe conduct of a given State lies outside the scope of the ICSFT, that State may nevertheles s be \\nresponsible under customary international law. \\n Secondly, Judge  ad hoc Pocar explains that, in hi s view, the  Court’s comprehensive \\ninterpretation of the term “any person” contained in Article 2, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT is obvious \\nfrom the ordinary m eaning of the terms, as established by the Court, but it is  also strongly \\nsupported by the object and purpose of the ICSFT , as well as by international practice in the \\n Thirdly, although Judge  ad hoc Pocar agrees with the co nclusion of the Court that the \\ninterpretation of the definition of “funds” is to be left to the stage of an examination of the merits , \\nhe does not agree with the inference of the Court that the interpretation of this term might have \\naffected the ratione materiae jurisdiction of the Court. He highlights that contrary to what the Court \\nstates, the definition of “funds” of Article 1, paragraph 1, puts the accent on assets, not on financial \\ninstruments. He adds that the list of financial instruments being unlimited, these legal documents \\nand financial instruments cannot play a role in circumscribing the scope of the Convention. Finally, \\nhe points out that the issue related to the provision of “assets of every kind” is not to establish what \\nkind of assets are included in the definition, but to establish which assets were actually provided or \\ncollected with the intention or the knowledge that they were to be used for unlawful purposes as \\ndescribed in Article 2, paragraph 1 (a) and (b). The question is therefore more related to the factual \\ncircumstances of the case. \\nDissenting opinion of Judge ad hoc Skotnikov \\n 1. Judge ad hoc Skotnikov regrets that he cannot support the decision of the Court that it has \\njurisdiction to adjudicate the case before it. \\n 2. He recalls that the existence of jurisdiction is a question of law to be resolved in light of \\nthe relevant facts. The alleged facts need to be ascertained to the extent which is appropriate in a \\ngiven case. Considering the Court’s conclusion at the provisional measure s stage  \\uf0be that all of \\nUkraine’s claims as to the rights it sought to protect under the ICSFT and most of its claims under \\nCERD were not plausible  \\uf0be Judge ad hoc Skotnikov is of the view  that particular caution is \\nrequired at the present to stage to determi ne whether the acts alleged by Ukraine fall within the \\nrespective provisions of the treaties Ukraine invokes. The Court has not exercised such caution, \\neither regarding whether Ukraine’s allegations relate to the offence of financing of terrorism as \\ndefined in the ICSFT or whether alleged measures amount to racial discrimination under CERD. \\n 3. With respect to issues of law, Judge ad hoc Skotnikov notes that the Court’s task at the \\npreliminary objections stage is to resolve issues relating to the scope of t he treaties in question. \\nConcerning the scope of the ICSFT, Judge ad hoc Skotnikov considers that the Court fails to satisfy \\nitself whether it has jurisdiction when it states that the issue relating to the scope of the term \\n“funds” need not be resolved at this stage. He also does not agree  with the Court’s finding that \\npersons acting as State agents fall within the scope of the ICSFT, in view of the Court’s correct \\nconclusion that the financing by a State  of acts of terrorism lies outside the scope of the \\nConvention. \\n 4. Judge ad hoc Skotnikov regrets that the Court has failed to consider questions relating to \\nthe scope of the CERD. In particular, he points out that the right of the Crimean Tatar community  \\nto maintain its distinct ive representative instituti ons does not fall within the scope of the \\nConvention’s definition of “racial discrimination”. He also considers that the Court has not \\nanalysed whether the right Ukraine alleges to educ ation in one’s native language fall s within the \\nscope of CERD in the circumstances of the present case. \\n 5. Judge  ad hoc Skotnikov is not convinced by the Court’s reasoning as to whether the \\npreconditions contained in Article  22 of CERD are met, in view of the context and the \\n 6. Judge ad hoc Skotnikov considers that the present Judgment comes very close to implying \\nthat it is enough for an applicant to argue the existence of a connection, no matter how remote or \\nartificial, between its factual allegations and the treaty it invokes, in order for the Court to be \\nsatisfied that it has jurisdiction ratione materiae under that treaty to entertain the case. This \\ndeparture from the Court’s case law is not, in his view, a welcome development. \\n \\n___________ \\nINTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE \\nPeace Palace, Carnegieplein 2, 2517 KJ  The Hague, Netherlands \\nTel.:  +31 (0)70 302 2323   Fax:  +31 (0)70 364 9928 \\nWebsite   X   YouTube   LinkedIn \\n Summary \\nUnofficial \\n \\n \\n \\n Summary 2024/2 \\n 31 January 2024 \\n \\n \\n \\nApplication of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing  \\nof Terrorism and of the International Convention on the Elimination of All  \\nForms of Racial Discrimination (Ukraine v. Russian Federation) \\n \\nSummary of the Judgment of 31 January 2024 \\nI. GENERAL BACKGROUND (PARAS. 28-31) \\n The Court begins by recalling that t he present proceedings were instituted by Ukraine \\nfollowing events which occurred from early 2014 in eastern Ukraine and in the Crimean peninsula. \\nThe situation in Ukraine is very different today than it was when Ukraine submitted its Application \\nin January 2017. The Parties are presently engaged in an intense armed conflict that has led to a \\ntremendous loss of life and great human suffering. Nevertheless, with regard to the situation in \\neastern Ukraine and in the Crimean peninsula, the case before the Cou rt is limited in scope and is \\nbrought only under the provisions of the ICSFT and CERD. The Court is not called upon to rule in \\nthis case on any other issue in dispute between the Parties. \\n With regard to the ICSFT, the Applicant instituted proceedings relating to the events in eastern \\nUkraine, alleging that the Russian Federation failed to take measures to prevent and suppress the \\ncommission of offences of terrorism financing. In particular, the Applicant refers to acts and armed \\nactivities in eastern Ukraine allegedly perpetrated by armed groups linked to two entities that refer \\nto themselves as the “Donetsk People’s Republic” (DPR) and the “Luhansk People’s Republic” \\n(LPR). Other acts to which the Applicant refers were allegedly perpetrated by armed groups and \\nindividuals in other parts of Ukraine. With regard to CERD, the Applicant refers to events which \\ntook place in Crimea from early 2014, after the Russian Federation took control over the territory of \\nthe Crimean peninsula, alleging that  the Russian Federation has engaged in a campaign of racial \\ndiscrimination depriving Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians in Crimea of their political, civil, \\neconomic, social and cultural rights in violation of its obligations under CERD. \\n The Court recalls that, in its Judgment of 8  November 2019 on preliminary objections \\n(hereinafter the “2019 Judgment”), it considered that the dispute consists of two aspects: the first \\nrelates to the ICSFT and the second relates to CERD. The Court therefore defined the subject-matter \\nof the dispute between the Parties in the following terms: \\n “[I]n so far as its first aspect is concerned, [the subject -matter of the dispute] is \\nwhether the Russian Federation had the obligation, under the ICSFT, to take measures \\nand to co-operate in the prevention and suppression of the alleged financing of terrorism \\nin the context of events in eastern Ukraine and, if so, whether the Russian Federation \\nbreached such an obligation. The subject -matter of the dispute, in so far as its second \\nCERD through discriminatory measures allegedly taken against the Crimean Tatar and \\nUkrainian communities in Crimea.” ( Application of the International Convention for \\nthe Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and of the International Convention on \\nthe Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Ukraine v. Russian Federation), \\nPreliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2019 (II), p. 577, para. 32.) \\nThe Court further stated that, in the present proceedings, Ukraine is not requesting that it rule on \\nissues concerning the Russian Federation’s alleged “aggression” or its alleged “unlawful occupation” \\nof Ukrainian territory, nor is the Applicant seeking a pronouncement of the Court on the status of the \\nCrimean peninsula under international law. These matters do not constitute the subject-matter of the \\ndispute before the Court (ibid., para. 29). \\n In the same Judgment, the Court found that it had jurisdiction on the basis of Article 24, \\nparagraph 1, of the ICSFT and Article  22 of CERD to entertain the claims made by Ukraine under \\nthese Conventions. Thus, the jurisdiction of the Court is limited to the alleged violations by the \\nRussian Federation of its obligations unde r the two instruments invoked by Ukraine and does not \\nconcern the conformity of conduct of the Russian Federation with its obligations under other rules \\nof international law.  \\nII.\\n THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SUPPRESSION  \\nOF THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM (PARAS. 32-150) \\n The Court recalls that both Ukraine and the Russian Federation are parties to the ICSFT, which \\nentered into force for them on 5 January 2003 and 27  December 2002, respectively. Neither Party \\nentered any reservation to that instrument. \\nA. Preliminary issues (paras. 33-85) \\n Before addressing Ukraine’s claims under the ICSFT, the Court first considers certain \\npreliminary issues relevant to the determination of the dispute, namely the Russian Federation’s \\ninvocation of the “clean hands” doctrine, the interpretation of relevant provisions of the ICSFT and \\ncertain questions of proof. \\n1. Invocation of the “clean hands” doctrine in respect of the ICSFT (paras. 34-38) \\n The Court recalls that the Russian Federation requests the Court to dismiss Uk raine’s claims \\nunder the ICSFT on the grounds that the Applicant comes to the Court with “unclean hands”. \\n In this respect, the Court notes that the Russian Federation’s objection based on the “clean \\nhands” doctrine was raised for the first time in its Rejoinder filed on 10 March 2023. Given that the \\nRespondent raised the objection only at this late stage in the proceedings, the Court views its \\ninvocation as a defence on the merits. \\n The Court has hitherto treated the invocation of the “clean hands” doctrin e with the utmost \\ncaution. It has never upheld the doctrine or recognized it either as a principle of customary \\ninternational law or as a general principle of law. Furthermore, the Court has already rejected the \\ninvocation of the doctrine as an objection t o admissibility, stating that it “does not consider that an \\nobjection based on the ‘clean hands’ doctrine may by itself render an application based on a valid \\ntitle of jurisdiction inadmissible” ( Jadhav (India v. Pakistan), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2019  (II), \\np. 435, para.  61; Certain Iranian Assets (Islamic Republic of Iran  v. United States of America), \\nJudgment of 30 March 2023, para. 81). Similarly, the Court considers that the “clean hands” doctrine \\napplication is admissible. Accordingly, the invocation of the “clean hands” doctrine as a defence on \\nthe merits by the Russian Federation must be rejected. \\n2. Interpretation of certain provisions of the ICSFT (paras. 39-76) \\n Before addressing Ukraine’s claims under the ICSFT, the Court considers the interpretation of \\ncertain provisions of that Convention that are in dispute between the Parties.  \\n(a) Article 1, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT (paras. 40-53) \\n The Parties disagree regarding the meaning of the term “funds” as defined i n Article 1 and \\nused in Article 2, paragraph 1, and other provisions of the ICSFT.  \\n Under Article 2, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT, the provision or collection of funds is a constituent \\nelement of the offence of terrorism financing (the actus reus). The term “funds” is defined in \\nArticle 1, paragraph 1, as meaning:  \\n“assets of every kind, whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, however \\nacquired, and legal documents or instruments in any form, including electronic or \\ndigital, evidencing title to, or interest in, such assets, including, but not limited to, bank \\ncredits, travellers cheques, bank cheques, money orders, shares, securities, bonds, \\ndrafts, letters of credit”. \\n The Court first turns to the text of Article  1, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT. The definition of \\n“funds” in Article 1, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT  begins with a broad reference to “assets of every \\nkind, whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, however acquired”. The rest of that \\nparagraph provides a non- exhaustive list of doc uments or instruments that may evidence title to or \\ninterest in such assets. Those instruments include bank credits, traveller’s cheques, bank cheques, \\nmoney orders, shares, securities, bonds, drafts and letters of credit. Thus, while the phrase “assets of \\nevery kind” is an expansive one, the documents or instruments listed in the definition are ordinarily \\nused for the purpose of evidencing title or interest only with regard to certain types of assets, such as \\ncurrency, bank accounts, shares or bonds.  \\n The Court notes that the use of the phrase “but not limited to” in Article  1, paragraph  1, \\nsuggests that the term “funds” covers more than traditional financial assets. The term also extends to \\na broad range of assets that are exchangeable or used for their monetary value. For instance, precious \\nmetals or minerals such as gold or diamonds, artwork, energy resources such as oil, and digital assets \\nsuch as cryptocurrency may fall within the ordinary meaning of the definition of “funds” under the \\nICSFT where such assets are provided for their monetary value and not as a means of committing \\nacts of terrorism. In  addition, the definition in Article  1 specifically refers to “immovable” assets, \\nsuggesting that “funds” may include the provision of land or real estate. \\n Secondly, the Court takes into account the context in which the term “funds” is used in the \\nother provisions of the ICSFT, including Articles  8, 12, 13 and 18. Article  8, which concerns \\nmeasures for the identification, detection and freezing or seizure o f funds used or allocated for use \\nin the commission of the offence of terrorism financing, suggests that the term “funds” covers \\ndifferent forms of monetary or financial support. Similarly, under Article  12, paragraph 2, States \\nparties may not refuse a request for legal assistance on the grounds of bank secrecy, again suggesting \\nthat the ICSFT is concerned with financial or monetary transactions. Article 13, which provides that, \\nfor the purposes of extradition or mutual legal assistance, none of the offence s set forth in Article 2 \\nshall be regarded as “a fiscal offence”, further suggests that the ICSFT is concerned with financial \\nor monetary transactions. Finally, Article  18, which concerns the institution of practical measures \\nand other negotiable instruments, also suggests that the ICSFT is concerned with financial or \\nmonetary transactions. In the view of the Court, the context provided by these provisions suggests \\nthat the term “funds” as used in Article 1, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT, is confined to resources that \\npossess a financial or monetary character and does not extend to the means used to commit acts of \\nterrorism. \\n Thirdly, the Court also takes into account the object and purpose of the ICSFT in determining \\nthe meaning of the term “funds”. The preamble of the ICSFT demonstrates that that Convention was \\nintended to address the “financing” of terrorism, rather than terrorism generally. For example, th e \\npreamble states that “the financing  of terrorism is a matter of grave concern to the international \\ncommunity as a whole”. It also notes that “the number and seriousness of acts of international \\nterrorism depend on the financing  that terrorists may obtain ” and that “existing multilateral legal \\ninstruments do not expressly address such financing ” (emphases added). In this regard, the Court \\nrecalls that in its  2019 Judgment, it explained that “[a]s stated in the preamble, the purpose of the \\nConvention is to adopt ‘effective measures for the prevention of the financing of terrorism, as well \\nas for its suppression through the prosecution and punishment of its perpetrators’” ( I.C.J. Reports \\n2019 (II), p. 585, para. 59). The title of the ICSFT, which refers to “the Suppression of the Financing \\nof Terrorism”, also suggests that that Convention specifically concerns the financing aspect of \\nterrorism. Accordingly, the object of the ICSFT is not to suppress and prevent support for terrorism \\nin general, but rather to prevent and suppress a specific form of support, namely its financing.  \\n The travaux préparatoires confirm the above interpretation of the term “funds”. \\n A good-faith interpretation of the ICSFT must take into account the fact that the concern of \\nStates parties when drafting that Convention was not the means or military resources that terrorist \\ngroups might use to commit acts of terrori sm, but rather the acquisition of financial resources that \\nwould enable them, inter alia, to acquire such means, including weaponry and training. In this regard, \\nthe travaux préparatoires reveal that one of the key problems identified by the States negotiating the \\nICSFT was the use by terrorist groups of real or spurious  charitable institutions to collect funds for \\nseemingly legitimate purposes. \\n In light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the term “funds”, as defined in Article  1 of \\nthe ICSFT and used in Article  2 of t he ICSFT, refers to resources provided or collected for their \\nmonetary and financial value and does not include the means used to commit acts of terrorism, \\nincluding weapons or training camps. Consequently, the alleged supply of weapons to various armed \\ngroups operating in Ukraine, and the alleged organization of training for members of those groups, \\nfall outside the material scope of the ICSFT. In the present case, therefore, only monetary or financial \\nresources provided or collected for use in carrying out acts of terrorism may provide the basis for the \\noffence of terrorism financing, assuming that the other elements of the offence referred to in \\nArticle 2, paragraph 1, are also present.  \\n(b) The offence of “terrorism financing” under Article 2, paragraph  1, of the ICSFT  \\n(paras. 54-64) \\n Next, the Court turns to the interpretation of Article  2, paragraph  1, of the ICSFT, which  \\nprovides as follows: \\n “1. Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that \\nperson by any means, directly or indirectly, unlawfully and wilfully, provides or collects \\nfunds with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be \\nused, in full or in part, in order to carry out: \\n(a) An act which constitutes an offence within the scope of and as defined in one of the \\n(b) Any other act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any \\nother person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed \\nconflict, when th e purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a \\npopulation, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to \\nabstain from doing any act.” \\n The Court addresses several issues relevant to determining the scope of the offence defined in \\nArticle 2, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT (hereinafter referred to as “terrorism financing”).  \\n (i) The scope ratione personae of the offence of terrorism financing (para. 56) \\n The Court recalls its previous finding in the 2019 Judgment regarding the scope ratione \\npersonae of the ICSFT. The Court explained in relation to the phrase “any person” in Article  2, \\nparagraph 1, that  \\n“this term covers individuals comprehensively. The Co nvention contains no exclusion \\nof any category of persons. It applies both to persons who are acting in a private capacity \\nand to those who are State agents. As the Court noted  . . ., State financing of acts of \\nterrorism is outside the scope of the ICSFT; therefore, the commission by a State official \\nof an offence described in Article 2 does not in itself engage the responsibility of the \\nState concerned under the Convention. However, all States parties to the ICSFT are \\nunder an obligation to take appropriat e measures and to co -operate in the prevention \\nand suppression of offences of financing acts of terrorism committed by whichever \\nperson. Should a State breach such an obligation, its responsibility under the Convention \\nwould arise.” (I.C.J. Reports 2019 (II), p. 585, para. 61.) \\nAccordingly, while the financing of terrorism by a State, as such, is not covered by the ICSFT, that \\nConvention does require States to act to suppress and prevent the commission of the offence of \\nterrorism financing by all persons, including by State officials.  \\n (ii) The scope ratione materiae of the offence of terrorism financing (paras. 57-58) \\n The Court notes that multiple provisions of the ICSFT refer to the commission of “offences \\nset forth in article  2”, including Articles  4, 8, 9, 12 and 18. The Court notes that Article  2 sets out \\ntwo kinds of offences. First, the offence of terrorism financing, which is addressed in the chapeau of \\nArticle 2, paragraph 1, and second, the two categories of underlying offences or acts, which are \\nstipulated in Article 2, paragraph 1 (a) and (b) (hereinafter referred to as “predicate acts”).  \\n In the view of the Court, the phrase “offences set forth in article 2” should be understood to \\nrefer only to the offence of terrorism financing set out in the chapeau of Article 2, paragraph 1. The \\npredicate acts described in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 are relevant only as constituent \\nelements of the offence of terrorism financing. They are not themselves offences falling within the \\nscope of the I CSFT. If the phrase “offences set forth in article 2” was interpreted to include the \\npredicate acts referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 1, the obligations of States parties \\nunder the ICSFT would extend far beyond the prevention and suppre ssion of the financing of \\nterrorism and would apply, inter alia , to the suppression and prevention of those predicate acts \\nthemselves. Such an interpretation goes beyond the scope ratione materiae of the ICSFT. \\n (iii) The mental elements of the offence of terrorism financing (paras. 59-64) \\n The Court notes that Article  2 of the ICSFT sets out two mental elements of the offence of \\nterrorism financing (the mens rea ). According to that provision, the commission of the offence of \\nintention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be used” in order to carry out \\nthe predicate acts defined in Article 2, paragraph 1 (a) or (b). As the use of “or” indicates, these are \\nalternative mental elements. Accordingly, it suffices for the commission of the offence of terrorism \\nfinancing that either “intention” or “knowledge” be present. In support  of its claims, Ukraine relies \\nentirely upon the mental element of “knowledge”. Accordingly, the Court confines its analysis to the \\ninterpretation of the phrase “in the knowledge that they are to be used”, an element on which the \\nParties hold divergent views. \\n The Court observes that the ordinary meaning of the term “knowledge” is an awareness of a \\nfact or circumstance. For the mental element of “knowledge” to be established, it must be shown \\nthat, at the time of collecting or providing the funds in question, the funder was aware that they were \\nto be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out a predicate act under Article 2, paragraph 1 (a) or \\n(b), of the ICSFT.  \\n Article 2, paragraph 3, stipulates that “[f]or an act to constitute an offence set forth in \\nparagraph 1, it shall not be necessary that the funds were actually used to carry out an offence referred \\nto in paragraph 1, subparagraphs  (a) or (b)”. Accordingly,  the funder’s knowledge may be \\nestablished even where the funds collected or provided are not ultimately used to carry out a predicate \\nact. \\n A determination of whether the element of “knowledge” is present must be made on the basis \\nof objective factual circumstances. The element of “knowledge” may be established if there is proof \\nthat the funder knew that the funds were to be used for the commission of a predicate act. In this \\nregard, it may be relevant to look to the past acts of the group receiving the funds in order to establish \\nwhether a group is notorious for carrying out predicate acts; for instance, where a group has \\npreviously been characterized as being terrorist in nature by an organ of the United Nations. The \\nexistence of the element of “knowledge” may be inferred from such circumstances. On the other \\nhand, the characterization by a single State of an organization or a group as “terrorist” is insufficient, \\non its own, to displace the need for proof of the funder’s knowledge that the funds in question are to \\nbe used to carry out a predicate act under Article 2, paragraph 1 (a) or (b). \\n(c) Article 2, paragraph 1 (a) and (b), of the ICSFT (paras. 65-69) \\n Article 2, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT requires that for the offence of terrorism financing to be \\nestablished, the funder must act with the intention or knowledge that these funds are to be used to \\ncarry out an act defined in Article 2, paragraph 1 (a) or (b). The Parties disagree regarding the scope \\nand interpretation of these predicate acts.  \\n The Court  recalls its prior conclusion that the predicate acts stipulated in Article 2, \\nparagraph 1 (a) and (b), are themselves not offences falling within the scope of the ICSFT and are \\nonly relevant as constituent elements of the offence of terrorism financing. Indeed, it is not necessary \\nthat a predicate act should have occurred for the offence of terrorism financing to have been \\ncommitted. Accordingly, the Court only interprets the scope of Article 2, paragraph 1 (a) and (b), to \\nthe extent necessary to inform it s conclusions regarding the alleged violations by the Russian \\nFederation of its obligations with respect to co -operation in the prevention and suppression of the \\noffence of terrorism financing. \\n The Court notes that the Parties agree that the category of predicate acts specified in Article 2, \\nparagraph 1 (a), is defined by reference to the treaties listed in the annex to the ICSFT. With respect \\nto the category of predicate acts specified in Article 2, paragraph 1 (b), the Court notes that it is not \\nenough for deliberate killings or serious bodily injury to civilians to have occurred. It is also essential \\nto demonstrate that “the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, \\n(d) Proof of predicate acts under Article 2, paragraph 1 (a) or (b), of the ICSFT (paras. 70-76) \\n The question before the Court is whether the Respondent has violated its obligations under the \\nICSFT to take measures for and to co-operate in the prevention and suppression of terrorism \\nfinancing, including by acting to freeze the accounts of suspected terrorism funders, assisting in the \\ninvestigation of such offences, initiating prosecutions or otherwise taking practicable measures to \\nprevent the financing of terrorism. Answering this question requires the Court to interpret and apply \\na series of obligations invoked by Ukraine under Articles 8, 9, 10, 12 or\\u202f18 of the ICSFT. While the \\nCourt only examines allegations of offences of terrorism financing to the extent necessary to resolve \\nthe claims of Ukraine, its interpretation and analysis of the Parties’ ob ligations under Articles 8, 9, \\n10, 12 and\\u202f18 of the ICSFT is guided by its interpretation of Articles  1 and 2 of that Convention, in \\nparticular, its interpretation of the term “funds” as defined in Article  1. Consequently, it is not \\nnecessary for the Court to evaluate alleged predicate acts the commission of which is sustained solely \\nby the supply of weapons or other means used to commit such acts.  \\n The Court further recalls that the offence of terrorism financing is distinct from the \\ncommission of predicate acts. In order to decide on the alleged violation of the obligations invoked \\nby Ukraine, it is not necessary for the Court to first determine whether the specific incidents alleged \\nby Ukraine constitute predicate acts. \\n Finally, the Court notes that it does not have sufficient evidence before it to characterize any \\nof the armed groups implicated by Ukraine in the commission of the alleged predicate acts as groups \\nnotorious for committing such acts. In the circumstances, the funder’s knowledge that the funds are \\nto be used to carry out a predicate act under Article 2 of the ICSFT cannot be inferred from the \\ncharacter of the recipient group. Accordingly, to establish the element of knowledge, it must be \\nshown that, at the time the funds were allegedly collected or provided to the groups, the alleged \\nfunder knew that the funds were to be used to carry out predicate acts. \\n3. Questions of proof (paras. 77-85) \\n Addressing questions of proof, the Court notes that it is well established that, as a general rule, \\nit is for the party which alleges a fact in support of its claims to prove the existence of that fact. The \\nCourt recalls that it has sometimes allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and \\ncircumstantial evidence when a State lacks effective control over the territory where evidence is \\nlocated. This practice may be relevant for certain allegations made in the present case regarding \\nconduct that took place in areas over which Ukraine lacks effective control. \\n The Court further recalls that the stan dard of proof may vary from case to case, taking into \\naccount factors including the gravity of the allegation. In this regard, the Court has noted that charges \\nof exceptional gravity such as the crime of genocide, require proof at a high level of certainty . In \\nother cases not involving allegations of exceptional gravity, however, the Court has applied a less \\nexacting standard of proof. \\n Ukraine’s claims concern the Russian Federation’s alleged violation of obligations under \\nArticles 8, 9, 10, 12 and 18 of the ICSFT. Those obligations relate to the taking of specific measures \\nand co-operating in the prevention or suppression of the financing of terrorism. In the Court’s view, \\nthe Applicant’s claims, while undoubtedly serious, are not of the same gravity as those relating to \\nthe crime of genocide and do not require the application of a heightened standard of proof. \\n Thus, in deciding Ukraine’s claims, the Court, in addition to assessing the relevance and \\nprobative value of the evidence adduced by Ukraine, deter mines whether such evidence is \\n The Court also notes that each provision of the ICSFT invoked by the Applicant imposes a \\ndistinct obligation upon States parties to that Convention. In each case, the Court must first ascertain \\nthe threshold of e vidence of terrorism financing that must be met for an obligation under that \\nprovision of the ICSFT to arise. Such an evidentiary threshold may differ depending on the text of \\nthe provision under examination and the nature of the obligation it imposes. If the Court finds that, \\nfor a given provision of the ICSFT, the relevant obligation did arise for the Russian Federation, the \\nCourt must then determine whether the Russian Federation has violated that obligation. \\nB. Alleged violations of obligations under the ICSFT (paras. 86-147) \\n1. Alleged violation of Article 8, paragraph 1 (paras. 86-98) \\n The Court notes that Article  8 of the ICSFT imposes upon States parties various obligations, \\ninter alia, to identify, detect, freeze or seize funds used or allocated for  the purpose of committing \\nthe offences set forth in Article 2 of the ICSFT. The Court begins by considering the evidentiary \\nthreshold for an obligation under Article  8 of the ICSFT to arise. In the view of the Court, the \\napplicable threshold under Article 8 of the ICSFT may differ depending on the scope and nature of \\nthe precise obligation at issue. For instance, the obligation to identify and detect funds allocated for \\nthe purpose of terrorism financing entails a lower threshold than the obligation to freeze such funds. \\nSimilarly, the decision to freeze funds may involve the application of a different evidentiary threshold \\nthan the more consequential decision of seizing funds. Ukraine has not pointed to any specific funds \\nor accounts that the Russian Feder ation has allegedly failed to identify or detect. The Court notes \\nthat the Applicant is primarily concerned with the alleged non-compliance by the Russian Federation \\nwith its obligation to freeze certain funds belonging to individuals and organizations all eged to be \\ninvolved in terrorism financing. It is therefore necessary to ascertain the evidentiary threshold \\nrequired for a State party to the ICSFT to be required to freeze funds alleged to be used or allocated \\nfor terrorism financing. \\n The Court is of the view that the freezing of funds is a preventive measure that does not require \\nthat the commission of the offence of terrorism financing under Article 2 of the ICSFT be established. \\nAt the same time, the Court acknowledges that the freezing of funds is a serious step that can \\nsignificantly limit the ability of the holder of those funds to use and dispose of them. In light of the \\nforegoing, it is the Court’s view that the obligation under Article  8 to freeze funds only comes into \\noperation when the relevant State party has reasonable grounds to suspect that those funds are to be \\nused for the purpose of terrorism financing. \\n The Court notes that this standard of reasonable grounds to suspect is in line with that adopted \\nby the Financial Action Task Force in i ts Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing. The \\nFinancial Action Task Force is an intergovernmental body that takes action, inter alia, to tackle \\nmoney laundering and terrorism financing, including by issuing recommendations to assist States in \\nimplementing and fulfilling their obligations under relevant international instruments, such as the \\nICSFT, and monitoring compliance with them. The Court also observes that Article 8 provides that, \\nfor its implementation, “[e]ach State Party shall take appropr iate measures, in accordance with its \\ndomestic legal principles”. In this regard, it is relevant that Russian domestic law allows for the \\nfreezing of assets where there are “sufficient grounds to suspect” their use in terrorism financing. \\nThe Court considers that the standard used in Russian domestic law is analogous to one of reasonable \\ngrounds to suspect.   \\n The Court next seeks to determine whether the information available to the Respondent was \\nsufficient to oblige it to take action to freeze any partic ular funds. The obligations under Article  8 \\nare not, by its terms, contingent on a State party receiving information from another State party. \\nAccordingly, a State party may be required to take action under Article 8 regardless of the means by \\nwhich it becomes aware of particular funds used or allocated for the purpose of committing the \\nto the communications it submitted to the Russian Federation regarding the alleged use of certain \\nfunds and accounts for the purpose of committing offences under Article  2. The Court therefore \\nfocuses its analysis on these communications. \\n After examining the allegations and evidence, the Court concludes that they do not co ntain \\nsufficiently specific and detailed evidence to give the Russian Federation reasonable grounds to \\nsuspect that the accounts, bank cards and other financial instruments listed therein were used or \\nallocated for the purpose of committing the offences under Article 2 of the ICSFT. In particular, the \\ndocuments provide only vague and highly generalized descriptions of the acts that were allegedly \\ncommitted by members of the DPR and LPR and were alleged to qualify as predicate acts under \\nArticle 2, paragraph 1 (a) or (b), of the ICSFT. Accordingly, the evidence does not demonstrate the \\nfunders’ “knowledge” that the funds being provided would be used to commit acts that qualify as \\npredicate acts. Nor has Ukraine demonstrated that the Russian Federation should have been aware of \\nthis information from another source. In the absence of convincing evidence to the contrary, the \\nRussian Federation had no reasonable grounds to suspect that the funds in question were to be used \\nfor the purpose of terrorism financing and, accordingly, was not required to freeze those funds. \\n In light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that it has not been established that the Russian \\nFederation has violated its obligations under Article  8, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT. Therefore, \\nUkraine’s claim under Article 8 cannot be upheld. \\n2. Alleged violation of Article 9, paragraph 1 (paras. 99-111) \\n Article 9 of the ICSFT concerns the obligation of a State party to the ICSFT to investigate \\nallegations of the commission of terrorism financing offe nces by alleged offenders present in its \\nterritory.  \\n The Court once again begins by considering the evidentiary threshold for the obligation to \\ninvestigate the facts of an alleged terrorism financing offence to arise. The threshold set by Article 9, \\nparagraph 1, is relatively low. For the obligation to investigate to arise, Article  9, paragraph 1, \\nrequires only that a State party receive information that a person who has committed or who is \\n“alleged” to have committed the offence of terrorism financing may  be present in its territory. In \\ncircumstances where the information only “alleges” the commission of an offence under Article 2, it \\nis not necessary that the commission of the offence be established. Indeed, it is precisely the purpose \\nof an investigation to uncover the facts necessary to determine whether a criminal offence has been \\ncommitted. All the details surrounding the alleged offence may not yet be known and the facts \\nprovided may therefore be general in nature. Moreover, for an obligation to inves tigate to arise, \\nArticle 9 does not require that a State party receive information from another State party. Credible \\ninformation received from any other source may give rise to the obligation to investigate. \\n At the same time, however, the Court considers that Article 9 does not require the initiation of \\nan investigation into unsubstantiated allegations of terrorism financing. Requiring States parties to \\nundertake such investigations would not be in line with the object and purpose of the ICSFT. \\n If a State party has received sufficient information of alleged terrorism financing committed \\nby an individual present on its territory, it is required to undertake a meaningful investigation into \\nthe alleged facts in accordance with the laws and procedures it woul d ordinarily follow when \\npresented with information on the commission of a serious crime. Furthermore, in fulfilling its \\nobligation to investigate, a State party must also endeavour to co-operate with any other interested \\nStates parties and must promptly inform them of the results of its investigation (see Article 9, \\nparagraph 6, of the ICSFT). Such an obligation to co -operate in investigating terrorism financing \\noffences is also informed by the object and purpose of the ICSFT, which is, as stated in its preamble, \\nto “enhance international cooperation among States” in preventing and suppressing terrorism \\n The Court considers next whether the Russian Federation received sufficient information to \\nrequire it to investigate any alleged offences under Article  2 of the ICSFT. Ukraine has pointed to \\nseveral Notes Verbales sent from its Foreign Ministry to the Foreign Ministry of the Russian \\nFederation which, it argues, contained credible allegations of terrorism financing by individuals in \\nthe territory o f the Respondent. The Court focuses its attention on three of these documents. The \\nCourt observes that the other Notes Verbales submitted to the Court concern only allegations of the \\nprovision of means to be used to commit predicate acts, including the supply of weapons, ammunition \\nand military equipment. They therefore allege facts that fall outside the scope of Article 2 of the \\nICSFT.  \\n In the view of the Court, three Notes Verbales contained sufficiently detailed allegations to \\ngive rise to an obligation by the Russian Federation to undertake investigations into the facts alleged \\ntherein. The information received included a summary of the types of conduct allegedly undertaken \\nby members of armed groups associated with the DPR and LPR that Ukraine considered to constitute \\npredicate acts under the ICSFT, the names of several individuals suspected of terrorism financing, \\nand details regarding the accounts used and the types of items purchased with the funds transferred. \\nThe Court considers that such information met the relatively low threshold set by Article 9 and thus \\nrequired investigation by the Respondent. \\n In light of the above conclusion, the Court must then determine whether the Russian \\nFederation met its obligation to undertake a meaningful investigati on into the facts alleged in the \\nNotes Verbales. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation first responded to the \\nUkrainian communications in a Note Verbale dated 14  October 2014. In that communication, the \\nMinistry informed Ukraine about the “need to provide the Russian side with factual data on the issues \\nbrought up” in the Ukrainian communications. However, the Russian Federation provided no \\nclarification as to the precise additional information that was required. \\n Subsequently, on 31 July 2015, in response to the information received from Ukraine, the \\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation sent Ukraine a Note Verbale that included \\nfurther details on the actions taken by the Russian competent authorities. This included the results of \\ninvestigations into two of the alleged offenders. In both cases, the Russian Federation concluded that \\nthe individuals were not involved in providing financial support to the DPR and LPR. However, no \\nclear information was provided by the Respondent concerning the other alleged offenders described \\nin the Ukrainian communications as being present in Russian territory. With regard to one allegation, \\nthe Russian Federation stated that it had issued orders to obtain the personal data and account \\ninformation of the alleged offenders. With respect to several other alleged offenders, the Russian \\nFederation responded that the persons either “d[id] not exist in the Russian Federation” or their \\nlocation could not be identified. Finally, with respect to the information received in the Ukrainian \\nNote Verbale of 29 August 2014, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs merely responded that the \\n“investigative and operational work to identify the persons mentioned . . . is being processed at [the] \\ncurrent time”. \\n The Court takes note of the amount of time that elapsed before the Russian Federation provided \\nthe aforementioned responses to the Ukrainian Notes Verbales. In this regard, the Court observes \\nthat the 2019 Mutual Evaluation Report issued by the Financial Action Task Force regarding the \\nRussian Federation’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures stated that the \\nRussian Federation generally answers requests for mutual legal assistance “within one to two \\nmonths”. It is therefore notable that, almost one year after receiving the Ukrainian allegations, the \\nRussian Federation appeared to have failed even to identify several of the alleged offenders. \\nFurthermore, to the extent the Respondent encountered difficulties asce rtaining the location or \\nidentity of some of the individuals named in the Ukrainian communications, it was required to seek \\nto co-operate with Ukraine to undertake the necessary investigations and specify to Ukraine what \\n In light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the Russian Federation has violated its \\nobligations under Article 9, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT.  \\n3. Alleged violation of Article 10, paragraph 1 (paras. 112-120) \\n Article 10, paragraph 1, requires States parties to the ICSFT to either prosecute or extradite \\nalleged offenders of terrorism financing offences under Article 2. The Court observes that the \\nApplicant has not brought to its attention any requests for extradition concer ning alleged offenders \\nand that the Applicant’s argument accordingly appears to be limited to an alleged violation by the \\nRussian Federation of its obligation to prosecute. \\n The Court begins by noting that the wording of Article  10, paragraph 1, bears a st rong \\nresemblance to language found in many other international conventions, including Article  7, \\nparagraph 1, of the United  Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment of 10 December 1984 (hereinafter th e “Convention against \\nTorture”). \\n Just as with the obligation to prosecute or extradite in the Convention against Torture, the \\nobligations found in Article  10, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT are ordinarily implemented after the \\nrelevant State party has performed other obligations under the ICSFT, such as the obligation under \\nArticle 9 to conduct an investigation into the facts of alleged terrorism financing. Ordinarily, it is \\nonly after an investigation has been conducted that a decision may be taken to submit the case to the \\ncompetent authorities for the purpose of prosecution. The aut dedere aut judicare  obligation found \\nin Article  10 of the ICSFT does not impose an absolute obligation to prosecute. The competent \\nauthorities of the States parties to the ICSFT r etain the responsibility to determine whether \\nprosecution is warranted, based on the available evidence and applicable legal rules, so long as such \\na decision is taken in the same manner as in the case of other grave offences under the law of that \\nState. \\n The Court notes that the decision to submit a case to the competent authorities for purposes of \\nprosecution is a serious one that requires, at a minimum, reasonable grounds to suspect that an \\noffence has been committed. The Court recalls its finding that t he information provided by Ukraine \\nto the Russian Federation did not give rise to reasonable grounds to suspect that terrorism financing \\noffences within the meaning of Article 2 of the ICSFT had been committed. In light of that finding, \\nthe Court does not consider that the Russian Federation was obligated under Article 10 of the ICSFT \\nto submit any specific cases to the competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution.  \\n Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that it has not been established that t he Russian \\nFederation has violated its obligations under Article  10, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT. Therefore, \\nUkraine’s claim under Article 10 of the ICSFT cannot be upheld.  \\n4. Alleged violation of Article 12, paragraph 1 (paras. 121-131) \\n Article 12 of the ICSFT requires States parties to the ICSFT to assist other States parties in \\ntheir investigations into terrorism financing. In its oral arguments, the Applicant stated that, \\naccording to its data, 91 requests for legal assistance were made of the Russian F ederation between \\n2014 and 2020, of which only 29 were executed. The Respondent, for its part, submits that, during \\nthe same period, Russian authorities in fact received 814 requests for legal assistance from Ukraine, \\nof which 777 were fully executed. The Court is unable, based on the evidence before it, to verify the \\ncontentions of either Party. It may only assess those requests for legal assistance that were submitted \\nto the Court, which are limited to the 12  requests made between September  2014 and \\n The Court begins by considering whether the evidence demonstrates that the Russian \\nFederation failed to comply with its obligations under Article 12 with respect to these 12 requests for \\nlegal assistance. To this end, the Court must determine whether the requests fall within the scope of \\nArticle 12. In this regard, the Court recognizes that States possess significant discretion in \\nimplementing the ICSFT into their domestic law. All that is necessary for an investigation to fall \\nwithin the scope of Article  12 is that the subject -matter of the investigation pertain to offences \\ncovered by Article 2 of the ICSFT. The Court therefore does not consider that the ICSFT itself must \\nbe specifically mentioned in a request for legal assistance for the obligation under Article 12 to come \\ninto operation. \\n Of the 12  requests for legal assistance that have been submitted by Ukraine, only three \\ninvolved investigations into the provision of funds to persons or organizations alleged to have \\nengaged in the commission of predicate acts. These were the requests for legal assistance sent by \\nUkraine to the competent Russian authorities on 11 November 2014, 3 December 2014 and 28 July \\n2015, all of which concerned allegations that citizens of the Russian Federation were invo lved in \\nfundraising for the DPR or LPR. The other nine requests for legal assistance concerned either \\nallegations of the commission of possible predicate acts or allegations relating to the provision of \\nmeans used to commit such acts, including the supply of weapons, ammunition and military \\nequipment. In accordance with the Court’s interpretation of Article  1, such conduct does not fall \\nwithin the scope of Article 2 of the ICSFT and the requests containing such allegations therefore \\ncannot give rise to a vi olation by the Russian Federation of its obligations under Article  12. The \\nCourt therefore limits its analysis to whether the Respondent fulfilled its obligations under Article 12 \\nwith respect to the aforementioned three requests for legal assistance.  \\n The Court observes that, pursuant to Article 12, paragraph 5, of the ICSFT, the obligations \\nunder paragraph 1 of Article 12 must be carried out in conformity with other treaties of mutual legal \\nassistance in force between the relevant States parties. Applicable treaties in the present case include \\nthe European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 20 April 1959 and the \\nConvention on Legal Assistance and Legal Relations in Civil, Family and Criminal Matters of \\n22 January 1993.  \\n The requests for legal assistance of 11  November 2014 and 3 December 2014 both involved \\nallegations that members of the Russian State Duma were engaged in raising funds for the LPR and \\nhad posted public announcements online for that purpose. The request of 28 July 2015 contained \\nallegations that the Chief of the General Staff of the Russian armed forces was implicated in the \\nfinancing of “extra-legal armed groups” operating in eastern Ukraine and in the establishment of the \\nDPR and LPR. However, none of the three requests described in any detail the commission of alleged \\npredicate acts by the recipients of the provided funds. Nor did they indicate that the alleged funders \\nknew that the funds provided would be used for the commission of predicate acts. Accordingly, the \\nCourt considers that the requests for legal assistance cited by Ukraine did not give rise to an \\nobligation by the Russian Federation under Article  12 of the ICSFT to afford Ukraine “the greatest \\nmeasure of assistance” in connection with the criminal investigations in question. In view of the \\nabove finding, the Court is not required to determine whether the Russian Federation’s refusal of \\nthese requests for legal assistance fell within the permissible grounds for denying such assistance \\nunder the mutual legal assistance treaties in force between the Parties. \\n For the aforementioned reasons, the Court concludes that it has not been established that the \\nRussian Federation has violated its obligations under Article 12, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT. \\nUkraine’s claim under Article 12 of the ICSFT therefore cannot be upheld. \\n5. Alleged violation of Article 18, paragraph 1 (paras. 132-146) \\n The Court begins by considering the scope of the obligation imposed by Article  18, \\n“cooperate in the prevention of the offences set forth in article 2 by taking all practicable \\nmeasures, inter alia, by adapting their domestic legislation, if necessary, to prevent and \\ncounter preparations in their respective territories for the commission of those offences \\nwithin or outside their territories”. \\n The Court observes that the object of Article 18, paragraph 1, is to foster co -operation in the \\nprevention of offences under Article  2, rather than to directly prevent the commission of those \\noffences. Accordingly, the Court considers that it is not necessary to find that the offence of terrorism \\nfinancing has been committed for a State party to have breached its obligations under Article  18, \\nparagraph 1, of the ICSFT.  \\n The Court next examines the types of measures encompassed by Article 18, paragraph 1. The \\nCourt considers that the ordinary meaning of the term “all practicable measures” supports a broader \\nreading of Article 18, paragraph 1, than the Respondent suggests. The provision, by its term s, \\nencompasses all reasonable and feasible measures that a State may take to prevent the commission \\nof the offence of terrorism financing under Article 2 of the ICSFT. Such measures include, but are \\nnot limited to, the adoption of a regulatory framework to monitor and prevent transactions with \\nterrorist organizations. \\n The Court acknowledges that Article 18, paragraph 1, refers specifically to the obligation of \\nStates parties to the ICSFT to “adapt[] their domestic legislation”. However, this reference to \\nlegislative measures is preceded by the term “inter alia”, showing that it is only intended to be an \\nexample of the types of measures States are required to take, rather than a firm limit on the scope of \\nthe obligations imposed by Article 18. The Court also notes that Article 18 is the only article in the \\nICSFT that specifically mentions the “prevention” of terrorism financing offences. This context \\nsuggests that the phrase “all practicable measures” should not be interpreted too restrictively. Thus, \\nthe Court considers that Article 18, paragraph 1, encompasses a certain range of possible measures \\nto prevent terrorism financing, including, but not limited to, legislative and regulatory measures.  \\n The Court then turns to Ukraine’s submission that the Russian Federation has violated its \\nobligations under Article 18, paragraph 1. \\n The Court recalls its finding in its 2019 Judgment that “all States parties to the ICSFT are \\nunder an obligation to take appropriate measures and to co-operate in the prevention and suppression \\nof offences of financing acts of terrorism committed by whichever person” (I.C.J. Reports 2019 (II), \\np. 585, para. 61). This includes actions taken to prevent terrorism financing by State officials. At the \\nsame time, however, the Court also recal ls its finding that “[t]he financing by a State of acts of \\nterrorism is not addressed by the ICSFT” and consequently “lies outside the scope of the Convention” \\n(ibid., p. 585, para. 59). In essence, Ukraine requests that the Court find that the Russian Fed eration \\nviolated its obligations under the ICSFT not because of actions taken by State officials in their \\nindividual capacity, but because of the Russian Federation’s alleged policy of financing armed \\ngroups in eastern Ukraine. This request does not fall within the scope of Article 18 of the ICSFT and \\ntherefore cannot be upheld. \\n With respect to the Russian Federation’s alleged failure to investigate terrorism financing, the \\nCourt considers that these allegations are not covered by Article 18, but instead relate to Ukraine’s \\nclaims of a violation of Articles 9, 10 and 12, which the Court has already addressed. Moreover, as \\nfor Ukraine’s argument that the Russian Federation took no steps to investigate private actors who \\nwere openly financing terrorism, the C ourt considers that Ukraine has not substantiated such \\nallegations. Nor has Ukraine pointed to specific measures that the Russian Federation failed to take \\nto prevent the commission of terrorism financing offences. Accordingly, the Court sees no basis for \\nfinding a violation of Article  18 as concerns the Russian Federation’s alleged failure to investigate \\n Concerning the issue of the policing of the border between the Parties, the Court observes that \\nUkraine’s evidence concerning the alleged flow of support for armed groups operating in Ukraine \\nacross the border is limited to allegations relating to the supply of weapons and ammunition. The \\nCourt recalls its finding that the supply of weapons and amm unition as a means for committing \\npredicate acts falls outside the material scope of the ICSFT. In the circumstances, the Court finds no \\nconvincing evidence demonstrating a failure by the Russian Federation to take practicable measures \\nto prevent the movement of “funds” into Ukraine for purposes of terrorism financing. \\n Finally, the Court examines whether the Russian Federation violated its obligation under \\nArticle 18 by failing to monitor and disrupt certain fundraising networks operating in its territory and \\nby declining to designate the DPR or LPR as extremist or terrorist in nature. With respect to the first \\ncomponent of Ukraine’s argument, the Court recalls its finding that the Russian Federation had no \\nreasonable grounds to suspect the funds in question were to be used for the purpose of terrorism \\nfinancing and accordingly was under no obligation to freeze those funds. In the absence of such \\nreasonable suspicion, the Russian Federation was likewise not obligated under Article 18 to restrict \\nall funding for the DPR and LPR. With respect to the second component of Ukraine’s argument, \\nconcerning the decision by the Russian Federation not to include the DPR and LPR on its list of \\nknown extremist and terrorist groups, the Court finds that, in the ci rcumstances of this case, the \\nRussian Federation was not under an obligation to designate a group as a terrorist entity under its \\ndomestic law, as a preventive measure. \\n In light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that it has not been established that t he Russian \\nFederation has violated its obligations under Article 18, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT. Ukraine’s claim \\nunder Article 18 of the ICSFT therefore cannot be upheld. \\n6. General conclusions on the alleged violations of obligations under the ICSFT (para. 147) \\n On the basis of all the preceding considerations and findings, the Court concludes that the \\nRussian Federation has violated its obligations under Article 9, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT. \\nC. Remedies (paras. 148-150) \\n The Court recalls that, in respect of its claims under the ICSFT, Ukraine has requested, in \\naddition to declaratory relief, the cessation by the Russian Federation of ongoing violations, \\nguarantees and assurances of non-repetition, compensation and moral damages.  \\n By the present Judgment, the Court declares that the Russian Federation has violated its \\nobligations under Article  9, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT and continues to be required under that \\nprovision to undertake investigations into sufficiently substantiated allegations of acts of terr orism \\nfinancing in eastern Ukraine.  \\n The Court does not consider it necessary or appropriate to grant any of the other forms of relief \\nrequested by Ukraine.  \\nIII.\\n THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION  \\nOF ALL FORMS OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION (PARAS. 151-374) \\n Having addressed Ukraine’s claims under the ICSFT, the Court then turns to the Applicant’s \\nclaims under CERD. The Court recalls that both Ukraine and the Russian Federation are parties to \\nA. Preliminary issues under CERD (paras. 152-200) \\n In addressing Ukraine’s claims under CERD, the Court first considers certain preliminary \\nissues relevant to its decision on this aspect of the dispute.  \\n1. Invocation of the “clean hands” doctrine in respect of CERD (paras. 153-155) \\n The Russian Federation contends that the “clean hands” doctrine precludes Ukraine from \\nmaking claims under CERD. \\n As indicated earlier, the Court does not consider that the “clean hands” doctrine is applicable \\nin an inter -State dispute where the Court’s jurisd iction is established and the application is \\nadmissible. Therefore, the Court cannot uphold the defence raised by the Respondent based on the \\n“clean hands” doctrine with respect to Ukraine’s claims under CERD. \\n2. Nature and scope of the alleged violations (paras. 156-161) \\n The Parties disagree about the nature and scope of the alleged violations to be examined by \\nthe Court in the present case. The Court considers that this disagreement between the Parties \\nregarding the nature and scope of the alleged violations to be examined by the Court is more apparent \\nthan real. Both Parties agree that the 2019 Judgment is determinative. In the 2019 Judgment, the \\nCourt rejected the objection of the Russian Federation, based on the requirement of exhaustion of \\nlocal remedies, to the admissibility of Ukraine’s Application. The Court held that this requirement \\ndoes not apply to the claim submitted to the Court by Ukraine because  \\n“Ukraine does not adopt the cause of one or more of its nationals, but challenges, on the \\nbasis of CERD, the alleged pattern of conduct of the Russian Federation with regard to \\nthe treatment of the Crimean Tatar and Ukrainian communities in Crimea” ( I.C.J. \\nReports 2019 (II), p. 606, para. 130).  \\n At the same time, the Court noted “that the individual instances to which Ukraine refers in its \\nsubmissions emerge as illustrations of the acts by which the Russian Federation has allegedly \\nengaged in a campaign of racial discrimination” (I.C.J. Reports 2019 (II), p. 606, para. 130). \\n Accordingly, the Court is not called upon to determine, in the operative part of its Judgment, \\nwhether violations of obligations under CERD have occurred in individual instances. This does not \\nprevent the Court from examining, “as illustrations”, any “acts by which the Russian Federation has \\nallegedly engaged in a campaign of racial discrimination”. In this regard, the Court notes that the \\nexpression “campaign of racial discrimination” has been used by Ukraine to characterize the Russian \\nFederation’s “overall pattern of conduct”. In its 2019 Judgment, the Court found admissible \\nUkraine’s claim alleging a “pattern of conduct” of racial discrimination by the Russian Federation. \\nThis may relate to each category of violations alleged by Ukraine. In order to arrive at the conclusion \\nthat a pattern of racial discrimination has occurred, the Court must be satisfied, first, that a significant \\nnumber of individual acts of racial discrimination within the meaning of Article  1, paragraph 1, of \\nCERD have taken place, and, secondly, that these acts together constitute a pattern of racial \\ndiscrimination. \\n3. Questions of proof (paras. 162-178) \\n Having established the nature and scope of the alleged violations to be examined in the present \\ncase, the Court notes that the Parties disagree with respect to a number of facts. The Court observes \\nto the inferences to be drawn from them for the purpose of proving an act of racial discrimination \\nand a “pattern” of racial discrimination. \\n The Court notes that the Parties disagree about various questions of proof. The Court therefore \\naddresses, in turn, the standard and methods of proof, and the weight to be given to certain forms of \\nevidence, before applying the relevant rules of international law. \\n(a) Burden and standard of proof (paras. 164-171) \\n The Court recalls the general principle that it is for the party alleging a fact to demonstrate its \\nexistence. Consequently, it is for Ukraine to demonstrate the existence of the facts alleged in support \\nof its claims. \\n While the burden of proof rests in principle on the party which alleges a fact, this does not \\nrelieve the other party of its duty to co‑operate in the provision of such evidence as may be in its \\npossession that could assist the Court in resolving the dispute submitted to it. The Court has also \\nrecognized that a State that is not in a position to provide direct proof of certain facts should be \\nallowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. Bearing in mind \\nsome of the obligations in question and the circumstances of the present case, including the lack of \\naccess of Ukraine to Crimea, the Court considers that the burden of proof varies depending on the \\ntype of facts which it is necessary to establish. \\n The Court notes that the Parties disagree on the applicable evidentiary standard for proving a \\n“pattern” of racial discrimination. It recalls that the standard of proof may vary from case to case, \\ninter alia, depending on the gravity of the allegation. In cases involving allegations of massive human \\nrights violations, the Court has previously required “convincing” evidence. In the present case, the \\nCourt assesses whether there is convincing evidence when considering the allegations made by \\nUkraine under CERD. \\n The Court therefore examines whether there is convincing evidence that individual acts of \\nracial discrimination have taken place and, if so, whether these acts together constitute a “pattern” of \\nracial discrimination. \\n(b) Methods of proof (paras. 172-178) \\n In order to rule on Ukraine’s allegations, the Court must assess the relevance and probative \\nvalue of the evidence proffered by the Parties in support of their versions of the facts in relation to \\nthe different claims. The Court recalls that it has applied various criteria to assess evidence. It \\nconsiders that racial discrimination may be proved by statistical evidence that is reliable and \\nsignificant, as well as by any other methods of reliable proof. \\n As to the weight to be given to certain kinds of evidence, the Court recalls that it will treat \\nwith caution evidentiary materials specially prepared for this case and also materials emanating from \\na single source. It will prefer contemporaneous evidence from persons with direct knowledge. It will \\ngive particular attention to reliable evidence acknowledging facts or conduct unfavourable to the \\nState represented by the person making them. The Court will also give weight to evidence that has \\nnot, even before this litigation, been challenged by impartial persons for the correctness of what it \\ncontains. \\n The Court has also stated that the probative value of reports from official or independent bodies \\n“depends, among other things, on (1) the source of the item of evidence (for instance \\npartisan, or neutral), (2) the process by which it has been generated (for instance an \\n(3) the quality or character of the item (such as statement s against interest, and agreed \\nor uncontested facts)” (Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment \\nof the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. Serbia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2015 (I), p. 76, \\npara. 190; see also Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic \\nof the Congo v. Uganda), Reparations, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2022 (I), p. 56, \\npara. 122). \\n The Court considers the probative value of such reports on a case-by-case basis, in accordance \\nwith these criteria. \\n Concerning statements by witnesses, the Court recalls that “witness statements which are \\ncollected many years after the relevant events, especially when not supported by corroborating \\ndocumentation, must be treated with caution” ( Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo \\n(Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda), Reparations, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2022 (I), \\np. 63, para. 147).   \\nMoreover, the Court has noted that “any part of the testimony given which was not a statement of \\nfact, but a mere expression of opinion as to the probability or otherwise of the existence of such facts, \\nnot directly known to the witness . . . cannot take the place of evidence” (Military and Paramilitary \\nActivities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Me rits, Judgment, \\nI.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 42, para. 68). \\nIn determining the probative value of evidence provided by a party, the Court also treats with caution \\nstatements by witnesses who are not disinterested in the outcome of the case, especially when not \\nsupported by corroborating documentation. In determining the evidentiary weight of any witness \\nstatement, the Court will take these considerations into account. \\n Finally, the Court has held that certain materials, such as press articles and extracts from \\npublications, are regarded not as evidence capable of proving facts, but as material which can \\nnevertheless contribute, in some circumstances, to corroborating the existence of a fact, i.e. as \\nillustrative material additional to other sources of evidence or  when they are wholly consistent and \\nconcordant as to the main facts and circumstances of the case. The Court sees no reason to depart \\nfrom this approach when assessing the probative value of such materials.  \\n4. Article 1, paragraph 1, of CERD (paras. 179-197) \\n The Parties disagree on the meaning of “racial discrimination” in Article 1, paragraph 1, of \\nCERD as well as on whether any conduct of the Russian Federation qualifies as racial discrimination \\nwithin the meaning of that provision. The Court interpret s, at the outset, the term “racial \\ndiscrimination” under Article 1, paragraph 1, of the Convention to the extent that it is necessary to \\ndetermine whether the Russian Federation has violated substantive or procedural obligations under \\nCERD.  \\n The Court notes that Article 1, paragraph 1, of CERD provides that \\n“the term ‘racial discrimination’ shall mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction or \\npreference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the \\npurpose or effect of nullify ing or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on \\nan equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, \\nsocial, cultural or any other field of public life”. \\n The Convention prohibits all forms and manifestations of racial discrimination as set forth by \\nthis definition. Accordingly, any differentiation of treatment that is “based on” one of the prohibited \\nArticle 1, par agraph 1, of the Convention, when the resulting impairment of the recognition, \\nenjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms arises from its purpose or effect. \\n Any measure whose purpose is a differentiation of treatment based on a prohibi ted ground \\nunder Article  1, paragraph  1, constitutes an act of racial discrimination under the Convention. A \\nmeasure whose stated purpose is unrelated to the prohibited grounds contained in Article 1, \\nparagraph 1, does not constitute, in and of itself, rac ial discrimination by virtue of the fact that it is \\napplied to a group or to a person of a certain race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin. \\nHowever, racial discrimination may result from a measure which is neutral on its face, but whose \\neffects show that it is “based on” a prohibited ground. This is the case where convincing evidence \\ndemonstrates that a measure, despite being apparently neutral, produces a disparate adverse effect on \\nthe rights of a person or a group distinguished by race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin, \\nunless such an effect can be explained in a way that does not relate to the prohibited grounds in \\nArticle 1, paragraph 1. Mere collateral or secondary effects on persons who are distinguished by one \\nof the prohibit ed grounds do not, in and of themselves, constitute racial discrimination within the \\nmeaning of the Convention. \\n5. Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians as protected groups (paras. 198-200) \\n With regard to the question of protected groups under CERD, the Court recalls that the Parties \\nagree that Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians constitute ethnic groups protected under that \\nConvention. It sees no reason to call this characterization into question. The Court observes in this \\ncontext that the definition of racial discrimination in the Convention includes national or ethnic origin \\nand that these references to origin denote, respectively, a person’s bond to a national or ethnic group \\nat birth, as do the other elements of the definition of racial discrimination , namely race, colour and \\ndescent. Accordingly, the political identity or the political position of a person or a group is not a \\nrelevant factor for the determination of their ethnic origin within the meaning of Article  1, \\nparagraph 1, of CERD.  \\nB. Alleged violations of Articles 2 and 4 to 7 of CERD (paras. 201-370) \\n Before turning to the alleged violations of obligations under CERD, the Court recalls that its \\njurisdiction is limited by virtue of Article  22 of CERD to Ukraine’s claims under that Convention.  \\nIn the present case, the Court lacks jurisdiction to rule on alleged breaches of other obligations under \\ninternational law, such as those deriving from other international human rights instruments. \\nHowever, the fact that a court or tribunal does not have jurisdiction to rule on alleged breaches of \\nthose obligations does not mean that they do not exist. They retain their validity and legal force. \\nStates are required to fulfil their obligations under international law, and they remain responsible for \\nacts contrary to international law which are attributable to them. \\n1. Disappearances, murders, abductions and torture of Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians \\n(paras. 202-221) \\n The Court then turns to the specific allegations of violations of obligations under CERD, \\nstarting with allegations concerning disappearances, murders, abductions and torture of Crimean \\nTatars and ethnic Ukrainians. The Court first examines whether the acts of physical violence alleged \\nby Ukraine constitute instances of racial discrimination within the meaning of Article 1, paragraph 1, \\nof CERD.  \\n The Court notes that Ukraine relies on two main arguments to substantiate its claim that the \\nalleged acts of ph ysical violence were based on the ethnic origin of the targeted individuals. First, \\nactivists and secondly, Ukraine refers to reports of intergovernmental and non-governmental \\norganizations to show that individuals affected by acts of physical violence in Crimea were \\ndisproportionately of Crimean Tatar and ethnic Ukrainian origin.  \\n With respect to Ukraine’s first argument, the Court observes that reports by the Office of the \\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) confirm that several targeted persons were pro -\\nUkrainian activists, as well as members and affiliates of the Mejlis. The reports of intergovernmental \\norganizations and other publications relied on by Ukraine further indicate that the victims were \\nattacked for their political and ideological positions, in particular for their opposition to the \\nMarch 2014 referendum held in Crimea and their support for the Ukrainian Government. The Court \\nrecalls that the political identity or political position of a person or a group is not a relevant factor for \\nthe determination of their ethnic origin within the meaning of Article 1, paragraph 1, of CERD. The \\nCourt therefore considers that the prominent political role and views of these persons within their \\nrespective communities do not, as such, establish that they were targeted on the basis of their ethnic \\norigin. \\n With regard to Ukraine’s second argument, the Court observes that the limited statistical \\nevidence furnished by Ukraine is mainly derived from reports of intergovernmental organizations. \\nWhile the Court generally ascribes particular weight to reports by international organizations that are \\nspecifically mandated to monitor the situation in a given area, it must also take into consideration the \\nlack of access to Crimea of the Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine on whose observations \\nthe relevant reports are based. \\n Bearing these considerations in mind, the Court observes that the above -mentioned reports \\nconfirm that physical violence in Crimea was not only suffered by Crimean Tatars and ethnic \\nUkrainians, but also by persons of Russian and Central Asian origin. \\n The Court acknowledges that Ukraine is not in a position to provide further evidence owing \\nto its lack of access to Crimea. However, even when allowing a more liberal recourse to inferences \\nof fact and circumstantial evidence for that reason, the Court is not convinced by the evidence placed \\nbefore it that Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians were subjected to acts of physical violence based \\non their ethnic origin. In fact, any disparate adverse effect on the rights of Crimean Tatars and ethnic \\nUkrainians can be explained by their political opposition to the conduct of the Russian Federation in \\nCrimea and not by considerations relating to the prohibited grounds under CERD. Since the \\nconditions set forth in Article 1, paragraph 1, of CERD are not met, it is not necessary for the Court \\nto examine whether any of the acts in question are attributable to the Russian Federation, nor to \\ndetermine the precise date on which the Russian Federation started to exercise territorial control over \\nCrimea. \\n With respect to Ukraine’s claim that the Russian Federation did not effectively investigate the \\nacts of physical violence involving Crimean Tatar and ethnic Ukrainian persons, the Court recalls \\nArticle 6 provides that \\n“States Parties shall assure to everyone within their jurisdiction effective protection and \\nremedies, through the competent national tribunals and other State institutions, against \\nany acts of racial discrimination which violate his human rights and fundamental \\nfreedoms contrary to this Convention”. \\n The Court observes that Article 6 constitutes a procedural safeguard for the prohibition of \\nracial discrimination by establishing an obligation for States to provide effective protection and \\nremedies through judicial and other State organs against any acts of racial discrimination. This \\nobligation encompasses a duty to investigate allegations of racial discrimination where there are \\nreasonable grounds to suspect that such discrimination has taken place. In this regard, a violation of \\nArticle 6 does not require that a violation of any of the substantive guarantees under CERD has \\nthat racial discrimination occurred and measures to effectively investig ate the incident in question \\nwere not taken at the relevant time, even if these suspicions proved to be unfounded at a later stage.  \\n The Court takes note of the Russian Federation’s contention that it has conducted \\ninvestigations into the incidents of physical violence alleged by Ukraine. At the same time, the Court \\nobserves that doubts regarding the effectiveness of these investigations have been expressed in \\nreports of intergovernmental organizations. However, the evidence does not establish that the \\nRussian Federation failed to effectively investigate whether the acts complained of by Ukraine \\namount to racial discrimination. Ukraine has not demonstrated that, at the relevant time, reasonable \\ngrounds to suspect that racial discrimination had taken place e xisted which should have prompted \\nthe Russian authorities to investigate. Consequently, Ukraine has failed to substantiate its allegation \\nthat the Russian Federation has violated its duty to investigate under Article 6 of CERD.  \\n The Court concludes that i t has not been established the Russian Federation has violated its \\nsubstantive or procedural obligations under CERD on account of the incidents of physical violence \\nalleged by Ukraine. \\n2. Law enforcement measures, including searches, detentions and prosecutions (paras. 222-251) \\n The Court then addresses the allegations concerning the Respondent’s conduct in terms of law \\nenforcement measures, including searches, detentions and prosecutions. It first seeks to determine \\nwhether the law enforcement measures tak en by the Russian Federation constitute acts of racial \\ndiscrimination in the sense of Article  1, paragraph  1, of CERD  before deciding whether the \\nRespondent has violated its obligations under the Convention to prevent, protect against and remedy \\nsuch acts. \\n Accordingly, the Court begins by considering the question of whether the legislation adopted \\nby the Russian Federation in itself constitutes racial discrimination. \\n The Court notes that the conformity of the relevant laws of the Russian Federation, in \\nparticular the provisions on “extremist activities”, with the human rights obligations of that State has \\nbeen called into question by international judicial and monitoring bodies. In this regard, it notes that \\nboth the European Court of Human Rights and the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe \\nhave expressed concern that the Russian Federal Law on Anti -Extremism is very broadly worded, \\nthereby allowing wide discretion in its interpretation and application, thus leading to arbitrariness \\nand potential dangers to individuals and NGOs. \\n The Court observes that it is not called upon to review the compatibility of the domestic \\nlegislation of States parties to CERD with their international human rights obligations generally. \\nInstead, the Court’s role is limited  to examining whether such legislation either has the purpose of \\ndifferentiating between persons or groups of persons distinguished by one of the prohibited grounds \\ncontained in Article 1, paragraph 1, of CERD, or is likely to produce a disparate adverse effect, in \\nthis case, on the rights of Crimean Tatars or ethnic Ukrainians. \\n In this regard, no evidence has been put before the Court which would suggest that the purpose \\nof the relevant domestic law is to differentiate between persons, based on one of the prohibited \\ngrounds contained in Article 1, paragraph 1, of CERD. Instead, the above-referenced domestic legal \\nframework regulates the prevention, prosecution, and punishment of certain broadly defined criminal \\noffences. Moreover, Ukraine has not provided evidence that this legal framework is likely to produce \\na disparate adverse effect on the rights of Crimean Tatars or ethnic Ukrainians. Therefore, the Court \\nis of the view that the domestic legal framework in and of itself does not constitute a violation of \\nCERD. However, this finding is without prejudice to the question whether the application of such \\ndomestic legislation is in breach of obligations under CERD. The Court notes that both Parties \\non the one hand, and to persons forming part of the Crimean Tatar leadership, on the other. It \\ntherefore addresses these two categories separately and in turn. \\n(a) Measures taken against persons of Crimean Tatar origin (paras. 230-244) \\n The Court begins by emphasizing that law enforcement measures that are applied to persons \\nor groups solely on the basis of an assumption that they are prone to commit certain types of criminal \\noffences because of their ethnic origin are u njustifiable under CERD. In the present case, Ukraine \\nhas provided evidence suggesting that persons of Crimean Tatar origin have been particularly \\nexposed to law enforcement measures taken by the Russian Federation. The Court must therefore \\nexamine whether these measures had either the purpose of targeting Crimean Tatars or a disparate \\nadverse effect on the rights of members of this group.  \\n In this regard, the Court attributes considerable weight to reports of several UN organs and \\nmonitoring bodies according to which the measures in question disproportionately affected Crimean \\nTatar persons. In light of these materials, the Court finds that Ukraine has sufficiently demonstrated \\nthat the law enforcement measures concerned produced a disparate adverse effect  on the rights of \\npersons of Crimean Tatar origin. It is therefore necessary to consider whether such effect can be \\nexplained in a way that does not relate to the prohibited grounds in Article 1, paragraph 1, of CERD. \\n The Court notes that the stated purpose of certain measures appears to have served as a pretext \\nfor targeting persons who, because of their religious or political affiliation, the Russian Federation \\ndeems to be a threat to its national security. However, the Court is of the view that Ukraine has not \\npresented convincing evidence to establish that persons of Crimean Tatar origin were subjected to \\nsuch law enforcement measures based on their ethnic origin. Therefore, the Court does not consider \\nthat these measures are based on the prohibited gro unds contained in Article  1, paragraph  1, of \\nCERD.  \\n With respect to Ukraine’s claim that the Russian Federation violated Article 4 of CERD, the \\nCourt notes that Article  4 (a) and (b) requires States parties to adopt immediate and effective \\nmeasures for the prevention, eradication and punishment of speech that seeks to promote or justify \\nracial hatred or to incite discrimination based on one or more of the prohibited grounds. Moreover, \\nArticle 4 (c) specifically provides that State parties shall not permit “public authorities or public \\ninstitutions, national or local, to promote or incite racial discrimination”. However, in the present \\ncase, the Court is not convinced that Ukraine has presented convincing evidence that statements have \\nbeen made by State offi cials of the Russian Federation that were directed against Crimean Tatars \\nbased on their ethnic or national origin. Nor did Ukraine prove its allegation that the Russian \\nFederation failed to comply with its obligation to prevent, eradicate and punish speec h by private \\npersons seeking to promote or justify racial hatred against Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians \\nbased on their national or ethnic origin.  \\n Turning to Ukraine’s claims that the Russian Federation violated Article 6 by failing to \\ninvestigate e ffectively allegations of discriminatory law-enforcement measures taken against \\nCrimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians, the Court considers that Ukraine failed to demonstrate that \\nthere were, at the relevant time, reasonable grounds to suspect that racial di scrimination had taken \\nplace, which should have prompted the Russian authorities to investigate. Therefore, the Court is not \\npersuaded that Ukraine has established that the Russian Federation violated its obligation to \\ninvestigate. \\n For these reasons, the Court is not convinced that the Russian Federation has engaged in law \\nenforcement measures that discriminate against persons of Crimean Tatar origin based on their ethnic \\n(b) Measures taken against the Mejlis (paras. 245-251) \\n Turning to measures taken against persons forming part of the Crimean Tatar leadership, the \\nCourt notes that the Russian Federation does not contest the occurrence of the alleged measures taken \\nagainst the Mejlis prior to its ban and against Crimean Tatar leaders, but disputes that they constitute \\nacts of racial discrimination under CERD. \\n The Court recalls that the fact that targeted persons belong to the leadership of an ethnic group \\ndoes not, in and of itself, suffice to establish that measures which adv ersely affect such persons \\namount to racial discrimination. Ukraine would also need to demonstrate that the relevant measures \\nwere “based on” the ethnic origin of the persons or the ethnically representative character of the \\ninstitutions subjected to these measures. The Court considers that the context in which the measures \\nwere taken indicates that they were in response to the political opposition that these persons and \\ninstitutions displayed against the exercise of territorial control by the Russian Federation in Crimea.  \\n In the Court’s view, Ukraine has not substantiated the claim that Crimean Tatar leaders who \\nhad engaged in political opposition against the control of Crimea by the Russian Federation were \\ndisproportionately affected by law enforcement m easures compared with other persons who were \\nengaged in similar conduct. The Court thus considers that the measures concerned were not based on \\nthe ethnic origin of the targeted persons and thus do not fall within the scope of Article  1, \\nparagraph 1, of CERD.  \\n The Court notes Ukraine’s allegation that the measures taken against the Crimean Tatar \\nleadership served to intimidate and unsettle the entire Crimean Tatar population. Ukraine invokes \\nwitness statements and reports by intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations in support \\nof those allegations. The Court recalls its observation that witness statements which are collected \\nmany years after the relevant events, especially when not supported by corroborating documentation, \\nmust be treated with caution. Given their lack of specificity with respect to those allegations by \\nUkraine, the Court finds that the reports relied on by Ukraine are of limited value in confirming that \\nthe relevant measures are of a racially discriminatory character. \\n Taking all these considerations into account, the Court concludes that it has not been \\nestablished that the measures taken by the Russian Federation against the members of the Mejlis were \\nbased on the ethnic origin of the persons concerned. \\n3. Ban on the Mejlis (paras. 252-275) \\n The Court next addresses the Parties’ arguments regarding the ban on the Mejlis. It notes at \\nthe outset that various intergovernmental organizations and monitoring bodies have called upon the \\nRussian Federation to lift that ban because of its  negative impact on civil and political rights. \\nHowever, the Court does not have jurisdiction, in the present case, to examine the conformity of the \\nban on the Mejlis with the international human rights obligations of the Russian Federation generally. \\nInstead, its jurisdiction is confined by Article 22 of CERD to assessing the conformity of the ban on \\nthe Mejlis with the Russian Federation’s obligations under CERD. \\n The Court must determine whether an act of racial discrimination as defined in Article 1, \\nparagraph 1, of the Convention has occurred before it can decide whether the Russian Federation \\nviolated its obligations under Articles  2 (1) (a)  and (b), and 5  (a) and (c), of CERD. It thus has to \\nassess whether the ban on the Mejlis constitutes an act of racial discrimination within the meaning \\nof Article 1, paragraph 1, of CERD. To this end, the Court examine whether the ban on the Mejlis \\namounts to a differentiation of treatment that is based on a prohibited ground and whether it has the \\npurpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal \\n The ban entails the exclusion of the Mejlis  from public life in Crimea. However, for the ban \\nto amount to racial discrimination, Ukraine would also need to demonstrate that this exclusion was \\nbased on the ethnic origin of the Crimean Tatars as a group or of the members of the Mejlis, and that \\nit had the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the enjoyment of their rights. \\n The Court acknowledges that the Mejlis  has historically played an important role in \\nrepresenting the interests of the Crimean Tatar community since that community resettled in Crimea \\nin 1991, after being deported to Central Asia in 1944. At the same time, the Court is of the view that \\nthe Mejlis is neither the only, nor the primary institution representing the Crimean Tatar community. \\nThe Court does not need to decide whether the Crimean Tatar institutions that were established after \\n2014 also play a role in genuinely representing the Crimean Tatar people. It suffices for the Court to \\nobserve that the Mejlis is the executive body of the Qurulta y by which its members are elected and \\nto which they remain responsible. The Qurultay is, in turn, elected directly by the Crimean Tatar \\npeople. The Qurultay has not been banned, nor is there sufficient evidence before the Court that it \\nhas been effectively prevented by the authorities of the Russian Federation from fulfilling its role in \\nrepresenting the Crimean Tatar community. Therefore, the Court is not convinced that Ukraine has \\nsubstantiated its claim that the ban on the Mejlis deprived the wider Crimean Tatar population of its \\nrepresentation. It follows that it is not necessary in this case for the Court to determine under which \\ncircumstances the treatment of institutions representing groups that are distinguished by their \\nnational or ethnic origin may violate obligations under CERD. \\n The ban on the Mejlis, by its very nature, also produces a disparate adverse effect on the rights \\nof persons of Crimean Tatar origin in so far as the members of the Mejlis are, without exception, of \\nCrimean Tatar origin. However, the Court needs to assess whether this effect can be explained in a \\nway that does not relate to the prohibited grounds in Article 1, paragraph 1. \\n Based on the evidence before it, it appears to the Court that the Mejlis  was banned due to the \\npolitical activities carried out by some of its leaders in opposition to the Russian Federation, rather \\nthan on grounds of their ethnic origin. \\n The Court thus concludes that Ukraine has not provided convincing evidence that the ban of \\nthe Mejlis was based on t he ethnic origin of its members, rather than its political positions and \\nactivities, and would therefore constitute an act of discrimination within the meaning of Article  1, \\nparagraph 1, of CERD. \\n With respect to Ukraine’s claim that the Russian Federation  violated Article 4 of CERD, the \\nCourt is not satisfied that Ukraine has convincingly established that, by adopting the ban of the \\nMejlis, authorities or institutions of the Russian Federation promoted or incited racial discrimination. \\nThe Court is thus not persuaded that the Russian Federation violated its obligations under this \\nprovision. \\n Turning to Ukraine’s claim that the Russian Federation violated its obligations under Article 6 \\nof CERD by failing to provide effective redress against the ban on the Mejlis, the Court observes that \\nUkraine did not establish that effective redress was denied by the Russian Federation.  \\n For these reasons the Court concludes that it has not been established that the Russian \\nFederation has violated its obligations under CERD by imposing a ban on the Mejlis.  \\n4. Measures relating to citizenship (paras. 276-288) \\n The Court then turns to the claims relating to measures relating to citizenship. In particular, \\nthe Court must determine whether the citizenship régime introduced by the Russian Federation in \\n The Court notes that differential treatment between citizens and non -citizens and legal \\nprovisions of States parties concerning nationality, citi zenship or naturalization are per se excluded \\nfrom the scope of the Convention. These paragraphs imply that CERD is not concerned with the \\ngrounds on which, or the way in which, nationality is granted. However, they cannot be understood \\nas excluding from t he scope of CERD any application of citizenship laws that results in an act of \\ndiscrimination based on national or ethnic origin by purpose or effect.  \\n In the present case, the Court does not find that Ukraine has convincingly established that the \\napplication of the Russian citizenship régime in Crimea amounts to a differentiation of treatment \\nbased on ethnic origin. To establish discrimination against Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians \\nbased on their ethnic origin, Ukraine mainly relies on the difficult y faced by the persons concerned \\nwhen choosing between the legal consequences of adopting Russian citizenship or retaining \\nUkrainian citizenship. However, the Court is of the view that those legal consequences flow from \\nthe status of being either a Russian citizen or a foreigner. The respective status applies to all persons \\nover whom the Russian Federation exercises jurisdiction regardless of their ethnic origin. While the \\nmeasures may affect a significant number of Crimean Tatars or ethnic Ukrainians residing in Crimea, \\nthis does not constitute racial discrimination under the Convention. \\n For these reasons, the Court concludes that it has not been established that the Russian \\nFederation has violated its obligations under CERD through the adoption and applic ation of its \\ncitizenship régime in Crimea. \\n5. Measures relating to culturally significant gatherings (paras. 289-306) \\n With regard to measures relating to culturally significant gatherings, the Court observes that \\nthe determination of a violation of the Russian Federation’s obligations under CERD requires that \\nthe restrictions of gatherings by Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians constitute acts of racial \\ndiscrimination in the sense of Article 1, paragraph 1, thereof. \\n In this regard, the Court takes note  of Ukraine’s claim that the measures undertaken by the \\nRussian Federation were based on legislation which is prone to being abused for discriminatory \\ntreatment. The Court observes that the conformity of the relevant laws of the Russian Federation, \\nnotably the provisions on “extremism”, with that State’s human rights obligations has been called \\ninto question by international judicial and expert bodies owing to the risk of arbitrary interpretation \\nand abuse. \\n The domestic legal framework regulates the preven tion, prosecution, and punishment of \\ncertain broadly defined criminal offences. There is no evidence that would suggest that the purpose \\nof the relevant domestic legislation is to differentiate based on one of the prohibited grounds \\ncontained in Article 1, paragraph 1, of CERD. Moreover, Ukraine has not provided evidence that this \\nlegal framework is likely to produce a disparate adverse effect on the rights of persons of Crimean \\nTatar or ethnic Ukrainian origin. Therefore, the Court is of the view that the domestic legal \\nframework does not, in and of itself, constitute a violation of an obligation under CERD. However, \\nthis finding is without prejudice to the question whether the application of the relevant domestic \\nlegislation constitutes an act of discrimin ation based on one of the prohibited grounds under \\nArticle 1, paragraph 1, of CERD by its effect. \\n The Court observes that reports by intergovernmental and non- governmental organizations \\nsuggest that prohibitions and other restrictions imposed on gatherings commemorating certain events \\nproduced a disparate adverse effect on the rights of Crimean Tatars. \\n As far as restrictions on culturally significant gatherings by ethnic Ukrainians are concerned, \\nthe Court considers it to be proved that the Russian Federa tion imposed restrictive measures \\nmeasures produced a disparate adverse effect on the rights of persons of ethnic Ukrainian origin \\ninvolved in the organization of and wishing to participate in culturally significant events.  \\n However, the Court notes that the Russian Federation has provided explanations for these \\nrestrictions that do not relate to one of the prohibited grounds contained in Article 1, paragraph 1, of \\nthe Convention. There is evidence that certain ethnic Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar organizations \\nhave in fact been successful in applying to hold events and that multiple events organized by ethnic \\nRussians have been denied. Moreover, given the context of these restrictions, and the fact that the \\nECHR has in several decisions confirmed that the approach of the Russian Federation towards public \\ngatherings is generally restrictive, Ukraine has not, in the Court’s view, sufficiently substantiated its \\nassertion that the restrictions were based on one or more of the prohibited grounds referred to in \\nArticle 1, paragraph 1. Accordingly, the Court is not convinced that Ukrai ne has sufficiently \\nestablished that Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians have been discriminated against based on their \\nethnic origin. \\n For these reasons, the Court concludes that it has not established that the Russian Federation \\nhas violated its obligations under CERD by imposing restrictions on gatherings of cultural \\nimportance to the Crimean Tatar and the ethnic Ukrainian communities. \\n6. Measures relating to media outlets (paras. 307-323) \\n With regard to measures imposed by the Respondent in relation t o Crimean Tatar and \\nUkrainian media outlets, the Court observes that the determination of a violation of the Russian \\nFederation’s obligations under CERD requires that the relevant restrictions constitute acts of racial \\ndiscrimination in the sense of Article 1, paragraph 1, thereof. \\n The Court recalls that restrictions imposed on media organizations fall within the scope of \\nCERD only in so far as these media organizations are collective bodies or associations, which \\nrepresent individuals or groups of individuals and the measures imposed on them are based on \\nnational or ethnic origin by purpose or effect. It is, however, not necessary to determine whether the \\nmedia organizations concerned represent individuals or groups of individuals if the measures \\nimposed on these organizations are not based on national or ethnic origin. \\n The domestic legal framework regulates the activities of mass media and the prevention, \\nprosecution and punishment of certain broadly defined criminal offences. The Court observes that \\nthere is no convincing evidence which would suggest that the purpose of the relevant domestic \\nlegislation is to differentiate between media outlets affiliated with persons of Crimean Tatar or ethnic \\nUkrainian origin and other such outlets based on one of the prohibited grounds contained in Article 1, \\nparagraph 1, of CERD. Ukraine has also not provided evidence that this legal framework is likely to \\nproduce a disparate adverse effect on the rights of persons of Crimean Tatar or ethnic Ukrainian \\norigin. Therefore, the Court considers that the domestic legal framework does not, in and of itself, \\nconstitute a violation of the Russian Federation’s obligations under CERD. However, this finding is \\nwithout prejudice to the question whether the application of the relevant domestic legislation \\nconstitutes an act of discrimination based on one of the prohibited grounds under Article  1, \\nparagraph 1, of CERD by its effect.  \\n The Court is of the view that the reports of international organizations referred to by Ukraine \\nlend some support to Ukraine’s allegation that Crimean Tatar and Ukrainian media outlets have been \\nseverely affected by the application and implementation of the Russian Federation’s laws on mass \\nmedia and the suppression of extremism.  \\n The Court also observes that some of these reports suggest the existence of a link between the \\nmeasures taken with respect to Crimean Tatar media outlets and the ethnic origin of their owners or \\nintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations are vague and not corroborated by further \\nevidence with respect to the existence of racial discrimination. \\n On the evidence submitted by Ukraine, the Court cannot find that the measures taken a gainst \\nCrimean Tatar and Ukrainian media outlets were based on the ethnic origin of the persons affiliated \\nwith them. The Court is of the view that the explanations given by the Russian Federation, \\nparticularly the statistically substantiated comparison between the closure of media outlets in Crimea \\nand other territories, suggest that the restrictions were not based on national or ethnic origin. For the \\nsame reason, the Court is not convinced that Ukraine has established that the measures taken against \\npersons affiliated with Crimean Tatar media outlets were based on the national or ethnic origin of \\nthose persons. \\n For these reasons, the Court concludes that it has not been established that the Russian \\nFederation violated its obligations under CERD by imposi ng restrictions on Crimean Tatar and \\nUkrainian media and by taking measures against persons affiliated with Crimean Tatar and Ukrainian \\nmedia organizations. \\n7. Measures relating to cultural heritage and cultural institutions (paras. 324-337) \\n The Court the n turns to the claims concerning measures relating to cultural heritage and \\ncultural institutions. The Court takes note of concerns expressed by the CERD Committee of 1 June \\n2023 regarding reports of the destruction of and damage to Crimean Tatar cultural heritage, including \\ntombstones, monuments and shrines. \\n The Court observes, however, that the CERD Committee does not take a position as to whether \\nthe respective reports are accurate and does not rely on first -hand evidence. The Court moreover \\nfinds that Ukraine has not sufficiently substantiated its claims regarding the alleged degradation of \\nCrimean Tatar cultural sites. For these reasons, the Court is not convinced, based on the evidence \\nprovided by Ukraine, that the measures undertaken by the Russian F ederation regarding the sites in \\nquestion discriminate against the Crimean Tatars as a group. \\n With respect to Ukraine’s allegations concerning the degradation of certain aspects of the \\ncultural heritage of ethnic Ukrainians, the Court is of the view that Ukraine has not established that \\nany differentiation of treatment of persons affiliated with cultural institutions in Crimea was based \\non their ethnic origin. The Court notes that the Russian Federation has provided explanations for the \\nmeasures taken against the persons in question that are unrelated to the prohibited grounds contained \\nin Article 1, paragraph 1, of CERD. The Court also notes that the Russian Federation has produced \\nevidence substantiating its attempts at preserving Ukrainian cultural herit age and has provided \\nexplanations for the measures undertaken with respect that heritage. Ukraine, in turn, has not \\nsubstantiated how the closure of certain institutions would amount to discrimination based on ethnic \\norigin. \\n For these reasons, the Court concludes that it has not been established that the Russian \\nFederation has violated its obligations under CERD by taking measures relating to the cultural \\nheritage of the Crimean Tatar and the ethnic Ukrainian communities. \\n8. Measures relating to education (paras. 338-370) \\n The Court then examines whether the conduct of the Russian Federation with regard to \\neducation in Crimea qualifies as racial discrimination and violates the obligations contained in \\n Under Article 2 (1) (a), each State party undertakes not to engage in any act or practice of \\nracial discrimination against persons, groups of persons or institutions and to ensure that all public \\nauthorities and public institutions, national and local, act in conformity with this obligation. Under \\nArticle 5 (e) (v), States parties undertake to prohibit and to eliminate racial discrimination and to \\nguarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as to race, colour, or national or ethnic origin, to \\nequality before the law, notably in the enjoyment of certain categories of rights. Within the category \\nof economic, social and cultural rights, individuals have the right to education and training. \\n The Court considers that, even if Article 5 (e) (v) of CERD does not include a general right to \\nschool education in a minority language, the prohibition of racial discrimination under \\nArticle 2 (1) (a) of CERD and the right to education under Article 5 (e) (v), may, under certain \\ncircumstances, set limits to changes in the provision of school education in the language of a national \\nor ethnic minority. For those provisions to apply, the Court must first determine whether the conduct \\nin question qualifies as racial discrimination within the meaning of Article 1, paragraph 1, of CERD. \\n Most of the measures complained of by Ukraine concern limitations to the availability of \\nUkrainian or Crimean Tatar as the language of instruction in primary schools. Language is often an \\nessential social bond among the members of an ethnic group.  Restrictive measures taken by a State \\nparty with respect to the use of language may therefore in certain situations manifest a distinction, \\nexclusion, restriction or preference based on descent, or national or ethnic origin within the meaning \\nof Article 1, paragraph 1, of CERD. \\n States parties possess a broad discretion under CERD with respect to school curricula and with \\nrespect to the primary language of instruction. However, in designing and implementing a school \\ncurriculum, a State party may not discriminate against a national or ethnic group. The fact that a State \\nchooses to offer school education in only one language does not, in and of itself, give rise to \\ndiscrimination under CERD against members of a national or ethnic minority who wish to have their \\nchildren educated in their own language.   \\n Structural changes with respect to the available language of instruction in schools may \\nconstitute discrimination prohibited under CERD if the way in which they are implemented produces \\na disparate adverse effect on the rights of a person or a group distinguished by the grounds listed in \\nArticle 1, paragraph 1, of CERD, unless such an effect can be explained in a way that does not relate \\nto the prohibited grounds in that Article. This would be the case, in part icular, if a change in the \\neducation in a minority language available in public schools is implemented in such a way, including \\nby means of informal pressure, as to make it unreasonably difficult for members of a national or \\nethnic group to ensure that the ir children, as part of their general right to education, do not suffer \\nfrom unduly burdensome discontinuities in their primary language of instruction.  \\n(a) Access to education in the Ukrainian language (paras. 358-363) \\n With respect to school education i n the Ukrainian language, the Court notes, and the Parties \\nagree, that there was a steep decline in the number of students receiving their school education in the \\nUkrainian language between 2014 and 2016.  \\n According to data from the OHCHR, t here was an 80  per cent decline in the number of \\nstudents receiving an education in the Ukrainian language during the first year after 2014 and a \\nfurther decline of 50  per cent by the following year. It is undisputed that no such decline has taken \\nplace with respect to school education in other languages, including the Crimean Tatar language. \\nSuch a sudden and steep decline produced a disparate adverse effect on the rights of ethnic Ukrainian \\nchildren and their parents.  \\n The Russian Federation exercises full control ove r the public school system in Crimea, in \\nHowever, it has not provided a convincing explanation for the sudden and radical changes in the use \\nof Ukrainian as a language of instruction, which produces a disparate adverse effect on the rights of \\nethnic Ukrainians. Here, the Parties disagree about the reasons for the decline in the number of \\nstudents receiving their school education in the Ukrainian language after 2014.  \\n The explanations put forward by the Russian Federation for the decline are not fully \\nconvincing. It is true that,  according to the OHCHR , the main reasons for this decrease include a \\ndominant Russian cultural environment and the departure of thousands of pro-Ukrainian Crimean \\nresidents to mainland Ukraine. However, even considering that many ethnic Ukrainian families left \\nCrimea after 2014, the Court is not convinced that this, together with the reorientation of the Crimean \\nschool system towards Russia, can alone account for a reduction of more than 90 per cent of genuine \\ndemand in Crimea for school instruction in the Ukrainian language.  \\n Both Parties have submitted evidence to the Court regarding the degree of freedom of parents \\nto choose Ukrainian as the principal language of instruction for their children. \\n The Court observes that the witness statements presented by both Parties were made by \\npersons who are not disinterested in the outcome of the case. They are also not corroborated by \\nreliable documentation. Although the Court is unable to conclude, on the basis of the evidence \\npresented, that parents have been subjected to harassment or manipulative conduct aimed at deterring \\nthem from articulating their preference, the Court is of the view that the Russian Federation has not \\ndemonstrated that it complied with its duty to protect the rights of ethnic Ukrainians from a disparate \\nadverse effect based on their ethnic origin by taking measures to mitigate the pressure resulting from \\nthe reorientation of the Crimean educational system on parents whose children had until 2014 \\nreceived their school education in the Ukrainian language.  \\n(b) Access to education in the Crimean Tatar language (paras. 364-368) \\n With respect to school education in the Crimean Tatar language, the Court notes that Ukraine’s \\nclaims concern the quality of the education available in that language, rather than its actual \\navailability or a significant change in the number of students. The Court is unable to conclude, based \\non the evidence submitted by the Parties, that the quality of the education in the Crimean Tatar \\nlanguage has significantly deteriorated since 2014.  \\n Regarding the alleged violation of the obligation under Article  7 of CERD, the Court recalls \\nthat under this provision States parties undertake to adopt immediate and effective measures, \\nparticularly in the fields of teaching, education, culture and information,  with a view to combating \\nprejudices which lead to racial discrimination. The evidence before the Court does not demonstrate \\nthat the Russian Federation failed to adopt immediate and effective measures against racial \\ndiscrimination. The Court concludes that it has not been established that the Russian Federation has \\nviolated its obligation under Article 7 of CERD. \\n(c) Existence of a pattern of racial discrimination (para. 369) \\n To find whether the Russian Federation violated its obligations under CERD in the present \\ncase, the Court needs to determine if the violations found constitute a pattern of racial discrimination. \\nThe legislative and other practices of the Russian Federation with regard to school education in the \\nUkrainian language in Crimea applied to all children of Ukrainian ethnic origin whose parents wished \\nthem to be instructed in the Ukrainian language and thus did not merely concern individual cases. As \\nsuch, it appears that this practice was intended to lead to a structural change in the educational system. \\nThe Court is therefore of the view that the conduct in question constitutes a pattern of racial \\nthe incidents with regard to school education in the Crimean Tatar language constitute a pattern of \\nracial discrimination. \\n(d) Conclusion (para. 370) \\n In light of the above, the Court concludes that the Russian Federation has violated its \\nobligations under Article  2 (1) (a) and Article 5 (e) (v) of CERD by the way in which it has \\nimplemented its educational system in Crimea after 2014 with regard to school education in the \\nUkrainian language. \\nC. Remedies (paras. 371-374) \\n Having established that the Russian Federation has violated its obligations under \\nArticle 2 (1) (a) of CERD and Article 5 (e) (v) of CERD, the Court turns to the determination of \\nremedies for this internationally wrongful conduct.  \\n The Court recalls that, in respect of its claims under CERD, Ukraine has requested, in addition \\nto a declaration of violations, the cessation by the Russian Federation of ongoing violations, \\nguarantees and assurances of non-repetition, compensation and moral damages.  \\n By the present Judgment, the Court declares that the Russian Federation h as violated its \\nobligations under Article  2 (1) (a) of CERD and Article 5 (e) (v) of CERD. It considers that the \\nRussian Federation remains under an obligation to ensure that the system of instruction in the \\nUkrainian language gives due regard to the needs and reasonable expectations of children and parents \\nof Ukrainian ethnic origin.  \\n The Court does not find it necessary or appropriate to order any other remedy requested by \\nUkraine. \\nIV.\\n ALLEGED VIOLATION OF OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE ORDER  \\nON PROVISIONAL MEASURES OF 19 APRIL 2017 (PARAS. 375-403) \\nA. Compliance with provisional measures (paras. 375-398) \\n Having addressed Ukraine’s claims under the ICSFT and CERD, the Court turns to the request \\nmade by the Applicant i n its final submissions that the Court adjudge and declare that the Russian \\nFederation has breached its obligations under the Court’s Order of 19 April 2017 indicating \\nprovisional measures. \\n The Court recalls that it indicated the following provisional measures in that Order:  \\n “(1) With regard to the situation in Crimea, the Russian Federation must, in \\naccordance with its obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination \\nof All Forms of Racial Discrimination, \\n(a)  Refrain from maintaining or imposing limitations on the ability of the Crimean \\nTatar community to conserve its representative institutions, including the Mejlis; \\n(b)  Ensure the availability of education in the Ukrainian language; \\n (2) Both Parties shall refrain from any action which might aggravate or extend \\n With respect to the first provisional measure, Ukraine claims that the Russian Federation has \\nviolated this measure by not lifting the ban on the Mejlis . It is uncontested between the Parties that \\nthe Russian Federation has neither suspended nor lifted the ban on the Mejlis . However, the Parties \\ndisagree about whether the chapeau of the provisional measure, by its reference to CERD, can be \\ninterpreted as leaving a margin of discretion for the Russian Fede ration as to how to implement its \\nobligations under the measure.  \\n The Court recalls that obligations arising from provisional measures bind the parties \\nindependently of the factual or legal situation which the provisional measure in question aims to \\npreserve. The Court is of the view that the reference in the Order of 19 April 2017 to the obligations \\nof the Russian Federation under CERD does not provide any scope for the Russian Federation to \\nassess, for itself, whether the ban on the Mejlis and the confirmation of the ban by the Russian courts \\nwere, and remain, justified. The formulation in the chapeau “in accordance with its obligations under \\nthe International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination” refers to the \\nsource of the rights which the measure seeks to preserve and does not qualify the measure nor confers \\ndiscretion upon the Party addressed to decide whether or not to implement the measure indicated.  \\n The Court therefore finds that the Russian Federation, by maintaining the ban on the Mejlis , \\nhas violated the Order on provisional measures. The Court notes that this finding is independent of \\nthe conclusion set out above that the ban on the Mejlis  does not violate the Russian Federation’s \\nobligations under CERD.  \\n With respect to the second provisional measure, the Court notes that the Order of 19 April \\n2017 required the Russian Federation to ensure that education in the Ukrainian language remains \\n“available”. In this regard, the Court takes note of a report by the OHCHR, according to which \\n“instruction in Ukrainian was provided in one Ukrainian school and 13 Ukrainian classes in Russian \\nschools attended by 318 children”, which confirm s that instruction in the Ukrainian language was \\navailable after the adoption of the Order. While Ukraine has shown that a sharp decline in teaching \\nin the Ukrainian language took place after 2014, it has not been established that the Russian \\nFederation has violated the obligation to ensure the availability of education in the Ukrainian \\nlanguage contained in the Order on provisional measures.  \\n The Court therefore concludes that the Russian Federation has not violated the Order in so far \\nas it required the Respondent to ensure the availability of education in the Ukrainian language. \\n In the Order on Provisional Measures, the Court also stated that “[b]oth Parties shall refrain \\nfrom any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute before the Court or make it more difficult \\nto resolve”.  \\n The Court observes that, subsequent to the Order on Provisional Measures, the Russian \\nFederation recognized the DPR and LPR as independent States and launched a “special military \\noperation” against Ukraine. In the view of the Court, these actions severely undermined the basis for \\nmutual trust and co-operation and thus made the dispute more difficult to resolve. \\n For these reasons, the Court concludes that the Russian Federation violated the obligation under \\nthe Order to refrain from any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute before the Court or \\nmake it more difficult to resolve. \\nB. Remedies (paras. 399-403) \\n The Court recalls that orders indicating provisional measures create a legal obligation for the \\nStates involved and that it is well established in international law that the breach of an engagement \\n The Court considers that its declaration that the Russian Federation has breached the Order on \\nprovisional measures of 19 April 2017 by maintaining the ban on the Mejlis  and has breached its \\nobligations under the non -aggravation measure contained in the same Order provides adequate \\nsatisfaction to Ukraine. \\n Regarding Ukraine’s requests for restitution with respect to the Mejlis, the Court finds that, \\nsince it has concluded that the ban on the Mejlis does not violate the Russian Federation’s obligations \\nunder CERD, no restitution can be due after the date of this finding, the assessment at the provisional \\nmeasures stage having not been confirmed on the merits. \\n The Court do es not find it necessary or appropriate to order any other remedy requested by \\nUkraine. \\nOPERATIVE CLAUSE (PARA. 404) \\n For these reasons,  \\n THE COURT, \\n (1) By thirteen votes to two,  \\n Finds that the Russian Federation, by failing to take measures to investigate facts contained in \\ninformation received from Ukraine regarding persons who have allegedly committed an offence set \\nforth in Article 2 of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, \\nhas violated its obligation under Article 9, paragraph 1, of the said Convention; \\nIN FAVOUR : President Donoghue; Judges Tomka, Abraham, Bennouna, Yusuf, Sebutinde, \\nBhandari, Salam, Iwasawa, Nolte, Charlesworth, Brant; Judge ad hoc Pocar; \\nAGAINST: Judge Xue; Judge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov;  \\n (2) By ten votes to five,  \\n Rejects all other submissions made by Ukraine with respect to the International Convention \\nfor the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism;  \\nIN FAVOUR: Judges Tomka, Abraham, Bennouna, Yusuf, Xue, Salam, Iwasawa, Nolte, Brant; \\nJudge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov; \\nAGAINST: President Donoghue; Judges Sebutinde, Bhandari, Charlesworth; Judge ad hoc \\nPocar; \\n (3) By thirteen votes to two,  \\n Finds that the Russian Federation, by the way in which it has implemented its educational \\nsystem in Crimea after 2014 with regard to school education in the Ukrainian language, has violated \\nits obligations under Articles 2, paragraph 1 (a), and 5 (e) (v) of the International Convention on the \\nElimination of Racial Discrimination;  \\nIN FAVOUR : President Donoghue; Judges Tomka, Abraham, Bennouna, Xue, Sebutinde, \\nBhandari, Salam, Iwasawa, Nolte, Charlesworth, Brant; Judge ad hoc Pocar; \\nAGAINST: Judge Yusuf; Judge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov;  \\n Rejects all other submissions made by Ukraine with respect to the International Convention \\non the Elimination of Racial Discrimination; \\nIN FAVOUR: Judges Tomka, Abraham, Bennouna, Yusuf, Xue, Salam, Iwasawa, Nolte, Brant; \\nJudge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov; \\nAGAINST: President Donoghue; Judges Sebutinde, Bhandari, Charlesworth; Judge ad hoc \\nPocar; \\n (5) By eleven votes to four, \\n Finds that the Russian Federation, by maintaining limitations on the Mejlis , has violated its \\nobligation under paragraph 106 (1) (a) of the Order of 19 April 2017 indicating provisional \\nmeasures; \\nIN FAVOUR: President Donoghue; Judges Abraham, Bennouna, Yusuf, S ebutinde, Bhandari, \\nSalam, Iwasawa, Nolte, Charlesworth; Judge ad hoc Pocar; \\nAGAINST: Judges Tomka, Xue, Brant; Judge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov; \\n (6) By ten votes to five,  \\n Finds that the Russian Federation has violated its obligation under paragraph 106 (2) of the \\nOrder of 19 April 2017 indicating provisional measures to refrain from any action which might \\naggravate or extend the dispute between the Parties, or make it more difficult to resolve; \\nIN FAVOUR: President Donoghue; Judges Tomka, Sebutinde, Bhandari,  Salam, Iwasawa, \\nNolte, Charlesworth, Brant; Judge ad hoc Pocar; \\nAGAINST: Judges Abraham, Bennouna, Yusuf, Xue; Judge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov; \\n (7) By eleven votes to four, \\n Rejects all other submissions made by Ukraine with respect to the Order of the Court of \\n19 April 2017 indicating provisional measures.  \\nIN FAVOUR: President Donoghue; Judges Tomka, Abraham, Bennouna, Yusuf, Xue, Bhandari, \\nSalam, Iwasawa, Brant; Judge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov; \\nAGAINST: Judges Sebutinde, Nolte, Charlesworth; Judge ad hoc Pocar. \\n \\n \\n Done in English and in French, the English text being authoritative, at the Peace Palace, \\nThe Hague, this thirty-first of January two thousand and twenty-four, in three copies, one of which \\nwill be placed in the archives of the Court and the others tran smitted to the Government of Ukraine \\nand the Government of the Russian Federation, respectively.  \\n \\n \\n  Joan E. DONOGHUE, \\n  President. \\n \\n \\n  Philippe GAUTIER, \\n \\n \\n* \\n President DONOGHUE appends a separate opinion to the Judgment of the Court; \\nJudges TOMKA, ABRAHAM, BENNOUNA and YUSUF append declarations to the Judgment of the \\nCourt; Judge  SEBUTINDE appends a dissenting opinion to the Judgment of the Court; \\nJudges BHANDARI, IWASAWA and CHARLESWORTH append separate opinions to the Judgment of the \\nCourt; Judge  BRANT appends a declaration to the Judgment of the Court; Judge ad hoc POCAR \\nappends a separate opinion to the Judgment of the Court; Judge ad hoc TUZMUKHAMEDOV appends \\na separate opinion, partly concurring and partly dissenting, to the Judgment of the Court. \\n \\n \\n___________ \\nSeparate opinion of President Donoghue \\n In her separate opinion, President Donoghue explains why she considers that, by banning the \\nMejlis, the Russian Federation violated its obligations under the International Convention on the \\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. She also believes that the Russian Federation \\nviolated its obligations under Article  12 of the International Convention for the Suppression of the \\nFinancing of Terrorism. In addition, President  Donoghue comments on the Court’s decisions \\nregarding the alleged violations of obligations created by the provisional measures Order of 19 April \\n2017, with which she agrees. \\nDeclaration of Judge Tomka \\n Judge Tomka explains that he has been unable to support the Court’s finding that the Russian \\nFederation, by maintaining limitations on the Mejlis, has violated its obligation under \\nparagraph 106 (1) (a) of the Court’s Order of 19  April 2017 indicating provisional mea sures. He \\nbegins by recalling that he did not support the indication of that provisional measure in 2017, for the \\nreasons provided in his declaration appended to the Court’s Order. He continues to believe that the \\nCourt went too far when it required the Russian Federation to refrain from maintaining limitations \\non the ability of the Crimean Tatar community to conserve the Mejlis . Be that as it may, in today’s \\nJudgment the Court concludes that the Mejlis  was banned by the Russian Federation due to the \\npolitical activities carried out by some of its leaders, and not because of their ethnic origin. \\nAccordingly, the Court concludes that it has not been established that the Russian Federation has \\nviolated its obligations under CERD by imposing a ban on the Mejlis. Judge Tomka notes that, \\ndespite this finding on the merits, the Court goes on to conclude in the present Judgment that the \\nRussian Federation has violated its obligation under paragraph 106 (1) (a) of the Court’s Order of \\n19 April 2017 not to impose limitations on the Mejlis . Judge Tomka wonders whether this finding, \\nwhich is somewhat surprising, is in harmony with the Court’s declaration that the Russian Federation \\nhas not violated its obligations under CERD. \\n Judge Tomka observes that the Court in today’s Judgment provides an interpretation of the \\nterm “funds” as defined in the ICSFT. The Court holds that the term “funds” refers to resources \\nprovided or collected for their monetary and financial value and does not include the means used to \\ncommit acts of  terrorism, including the supply of weapons or training camps. The Court then \\nconcludes that the alleged supply of weapons by the Russian Federation to various armed groups \\noperating in Ukraine falls outside the material scope of the ICSFT, meaning that th e Court has no \\njurisdiction ratione materiae  to deal with Ukraine’s claims concerning this alleged supply of \\nweapons. Judge  Tomka agrees with this conclusion. He recalls that he had reached the same \\nconclusion in his separate opinion appended to the Court’s 2019 Judgment on preliminary objections. \\nJudge Tomka regrets that the Court refrained from interpreting the term “funds” in its \\n2019 Judgment, leaving the issue to be determined in the present Judgment. Had the Court interpreted \\nthe term “funds” in 2019,  this would have spared the Parties unnecessary submissions, including \\nextremely voluminous evidence, on claims which are now declared to fall outside the scope of the \\nICSFT. For Judge Tomka, the Court adopted an approach that was not in keeping with the principle \\nof procedural economy. \\nDéclaration de M. le juge Abraham \\n Dans sa déclaration, le juge Abraham explique les raisons l’ayant conduit à voter contre le \\npoint 6 du dispositif. Selon lui, la reconnaissance des deux entités dites «  république populaire de \\nDonetsk » et « république populaire de Louhansk » comme des États indépendants et l’«  opération \\nmilitaire spéciale » lancée contre l’Ukraine par la Fédération de Russie sont totalement étrangères au \\nconséquent, que la solution judiciaire du différend soumis à la Cour n’a pas été rendue plus difficile \\npar ces événements. Il ajoute que les motifs retenus par la Cour à cet égard introduisent une \\nregrettable ambiguïté sur la question de la licéité des actions de la Fédération de Russie. \\nDeclaration of Judge Bennouna \\n Judge Bennouna expresses his disagreement with the Court’s decision that the Russian \\nFederation violated the provisional measure of non-aggravation indicated by the Court on 19  April \\n2017. He further notes that the Court has consistently maintained the position that it cannot order \\nnon-aggravation as an isolated measure, as it is intended to accompany concrete or specific measures \\nfor the preservation of certain rights. He believes that this measure does not carry the same obligatory \\nnature as specific measures designed to safeguard the parties’ rights. \\nDeclaration of Judge Yusuf  \\n Judge Yusuf does not agree with the Court’s conclusion that the Russian Federation violated \\nthe obligation on non-aggravation under the Order of 19 April 2017 to refrain from any action which \\nmight aggravate or extend the dispute before the Court or make it more difficult to resolve. \\n The Court made clear, in the present Judgment and in its Judgment of 8 November 2019, that \\nits jurisdiction is limited to the dispute between the Parties, which concerns only Ukraine’s claims \\nunder the ICSFT and CERD. Moreover, in its Order, the Court found that the conditions for \\nindicating measures in respect of Ukraine’s claims under the ICSFT, relating to events in eastern \\nUkraine, were not met. It only indicated measures relating to claims under CERD, in respect of events \\nin Crimea. \\n For Judge Yusuf, non-aggravation clauses are subordinate to substantive provisional measures \\nand their function is to avoid escalation and extension of the dispute so that the Court can settle it \\nthrough the law. The Court has never indicated a measure of non-aggravation other than as an \\naddendum to measures aimed at preserving specific rights of parties. Such an auxiliary measure \\ncannot be used to extend the scope of the Order or the obligations prescribed by it. \\n In this Judgment, the Court refers to the Russian Federation’s recognition of the LPR and DPR \\nas independent States and to the launching of a “special military operation” as the basis for finding \\na violation of the non-aggravation measure. Judge Yusuf, however, recalls that the non-aggravation \\nclause was connected to two measures indicated by the Cou rt in relation to alleged violations of \\nCERD in Crimea. The jurisdictional basis for those measures was CERD and a non -aggravation \\nclause could not, in the view of Judge Yusuf, extend such jurisdiction to the recognition of territorial \\nentities as States or to the armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. However, the \\nCourt has now applied the non-aggravation measure as having created obligations for the Russian \\nFederation with regard to the DPR and LPR in eastern Ukraine and the armed conf lict between the \\ntwo States. As a result, for Judge Yusuf, the Court has mistaken the legal basis and scope of the \\nnon-aggravation measure it indicated in the Order of 19 April 2017. \\n Judge Yusuf observes that Ukraine has instituted separate proceedings relating to a dispute \\nwith the Russian Federation concerning the events of February 2022 between Ukraine and the \\nRussian Federation. Those proceedings are still under consideration by the Court and are distinct and \\nseparate from the present case. They also h ave no relationship whatsoever to the non-aggravation \\nDissenting opinion of Judge Sebutinde \\n In her dissenting opinion, Judge  Sebutinde explains why she disagrees with some of the \\nCourt’s findings. In her opinion, the Russian Federation has violated its obligations under Articles 12 \\nand 18 of the ICSFT. The Russian Federation is also in violation of its obligations under the CERD \\nwith respect to measures taken against the Mejlis and in relation to the law enforcement measures \\ndirected at members of the Crimean Tatar population. Judge Sebutinde also elaborates upon the \\nCourt’s interpretation and conclusion with respect to the measure of non-aggravation indicated in the \\nCourt’s provisional measures Order. \\n In Judge Sebutinde’s view, the evidentiary threshold applied by the Court under Article  12 is \\nunnecessarily stringent and imposes an impracticable burden upon States requesting mutual \\nassistance. In her view, when making a request for leg al assistance, it is not necessary for a State to \\ndemonstrate that the alleged funders “knew” what the funds provided were to be used for. The \\nRussian Federation, by failing to provide Ukraine with any assistance at all in relation to Ukraine’s \\ninvestigation of possible terrorism financing offences, acted in violation of its obligation under \\nArticle 12 of the ICSFT. \\n Judge Sebutinde also finds that with respect to Article 18, the Russian Federation failed to take \\n“all practicable measures” that were within its disposal to prevent and counter preparations for the \\ncommission of terrorism financing offences. By endorsing the fundraising activities of officials and \\nprivate persons under its jurisdiction, for the benefit of the DPR and LPR and failing to take \\n“practicable measures” that were at its disposal to prevent, restrict or limit such fundraising activities, \\nthe Russian Federation acted in violation of its obligation under Article 18. \\n With respect to CERD, Judge  Sebutinde finds that the Russian Federation has violated its \\nobligations in relation to its law enforcement measures taken against persons of Crimean Tatar origin \\nand in relation to the measures taken against the Mejlis. In her opinion, the Russian Federation’s \\nindiscriminate enforcement of its anti -extremism legislation against members of the Crimean Tatar \\ncommunity had the effect of discriminating against Crimean Tatars on the basis of their ethnic or \\nnational origin. The Russian Federation’s actions taken under this legislation impaired the rights  of \\nmembers of this ethnic minority protected under Articles 2 and 5 (d) (viii) and (ix) of CERD.  \\n Furthermore, the ban against the Mejlis constituted an act of racial discrimination. The \\nrepresentative role uniquely played by the Mejlis as the executive body of the Crimean Tatar people \\nis neither equivalent to that played by the Qurultay, nor can it be replaced by that of any other \\nrepresentative body in Crimea, including the “Qurultay of the Muslims of Crimea” and the “Shura”. \\nTherefore, the ban had the effect of impairing not only the civil rights of the individual members of \\nthe Mejlis, but also the civil and cultural rights of the Crimean Tatar community to determine their \\ncultural leaders, in violation of the CERD. \\n Finally, Judge Sebutinde agrees with the conclusion that the Russian Federation has violated \\nits obligations under the provisional measures indicated by the Court by failing to refrain from action \\nthat might aggravate or extend the dispute before the Court or render it more difficult to resolve. \\nSeparate opinion of Judge Bhandari \\n In his separate opinion, Judge  Bhandari expresses his disagreement with the Court’s \\ninterpretation of Article  1, paragraph 1, of the International Convention for the Suppression of the \\nFinancing of Terrorism (“ICSF T”). In his opinion, the term “funds”, as defined in that provision, \\nincludes weapons, and the Court errs in holding otherwise. \\n Judge Bhandari states that the parties to the ICSFT intended to give a special meaning to the \\nthis Convention”. That special meaning is the starting point for any interpretation of the term “funds”. \\nThe focus of interpretation must therefore be on the intended special meaning. The C ourt, however, \\ncollapses the term “funds” and the special meaning that the parties to the ICSFT give to that term. \\n As Judge Bhandari notes, Article 1, paragraph 1, provides that “funds means assets of every \\nkind” without limitation. In his view, the Court’s interpretation departs from this ordinary meaning. \\nIn particular, Judge  Bhandari disagrees with the Court’s conclusion that the definition of funds in \\nArticle 1, paragraph 1, only includes limited categories of assets and does not include weapons. \\nAccording to him, the list of financial and other instruments listed in that provision offers examples \\nof documents or instruments  evidencing title to or interest in assets. These examples do not, by \\ncontrast, limit or determine the scope of the term “assets of any kind”. \\n Further, Judge  Bhandari states that the Court’s interpretation, according to which the term \\n“funds” also extends to a range of assets exchangeable or used for their monetary value, is \\nself-defeating. Like other assets, weapons can be sold and thereby exchanged for their monetary \\nvalue. It also strains the text to suggest that “funds”, as defined in Article 1, paragraph 1, cannot \\ninclude weapons when the definition specifically includes “tangible” and “moveable” assets, terms \\nthat typically refer to chattel property. Moreover, Article 1, paragraph 1, also refers to “immovable” \\nproperty. If “assets of any kind” can include real estate, it must also be capable of including weapons. \\n The phrase “where such assets are provided for their monetary valu e but not as means of \\ncommitting acts of terrorism” in the Court’s Judgment introduces a new, unsupported dimension, \\naccording to Judge  Bhandari. These words suggest that one and the same asset could either be \\n“funds” or not be “funds”, depending on the intention of the providing party. That is in tension with \\nthe text of Article  1, paragraph 1, which provides an objective definition of “funds”, and with \\nArticle 2, paragraph 1, which treats funds and intention separately. \\n Finally, according to Judge  Bhandari, neither the context of Article  1, paragraph 1, nor the \\nobject and purpose or the negotiating history of the ICSFT justify a departure from this reading of \\nthe definition of “funds”. \\nSeparate opinion of Judge Iwasawa \\n In his opinion, Judge Iwasawa elaborates on two points on which the Court has made important \\ndecisions in the present case. \\n 1. Judge Iwasawa recalls that t he Court has previously not accepted arguments based on the \\nclean hands doctrine either as a ground for the inadmissibility of a claim or as a defence on the merits. \\nNor has the Court denied the applicability of the clean hands doctrine before it entirely. In the present \\ncase, the Court rejects the clean hands doctrine as a defence on the merits in a situation where the \\nrespondent State argues in proceedings before the Court that the applicant State has engaged in \\nunlawful conduct. Judge Iwasawa considers that the Court does not address the applicability of the \\nclean hands doctrine in investment arbitration. \\n 2. According to Judge Iwasawa, international human rights courts and treaty bodies have used \\nsimilar frameworks for determining whether a differentiation of treatment constitutes discrimination. \\nA differentiation of treatment is considered to constitute discrimination, unless the criteria for such \\na differentiation are reasonable and objective; in other words, unless the differentiation pursues a \\nlegitimate aim and there is a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed \\n He considers that a measure based on a prohibited ground listed in Article  1, paragraph 1, of \\nCERD is inherently suspect. A State bears a very heavy burden of demonstrating that it is justified. \\nThe level of scrutiny must be most rigorous and the threshold must be especially high. \\n Judge Iwasawa then explains the notion of indirect discrimination  under CERD. If a rule, \\nmeasure or policy that appears on its face to be neutral has an unjustifiable disproportionate \\nprejudicial impact on a group distinguished by race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin, it \\nconstitutes racial discrimination, even if it is not specifically aim ed at that group. The analysis of \\ndisproportionate impact requires a comparison to be made between different groups. A \\ndisproportionate prejudicial impact on a group is unjustifiable, unless such an impact can be justified \\nby a legitimate reason that does not implicate any of the prohibited grounds under Article  1, \\nparagraph 1, of CERD. The context and circumstances in which the differentiation was introduced \\nmust be taken into account in determining whether it amounts to racial discrimination. \\n In the view of Judge Iwasawa, it is important that, even though the Court in the present case \\nhas refrained from using the term “indirect discrimination”, it has embraced the notion and laid down \\na framework for analysing indirect discrimination under CERD. The frame work laid down by the \\nCourt is consistent with the notion of indirect discrimination adopted by other international human \\nrights courts and treaty bodies.  \\n After laying down the framework for indirect discrimination, the Court adds that “collateral \\nand secondary effects” on persons who are distinguished by one of the prohibited grounds do not, in \\nand of themselves, constitute racial discrimination. According to Judge  Iwasawa, this addition is \\nwholly unnecessary because the framework adopted by the Court ca n fully explain why “collateral \\nand secondary effects” do not constitute racial discrimination. \\n Judge Iwasawa observes that, i n the present case, the Russian Federation does not deny the \\nnotion of indirect discrimination as such. Rather, it challenges the “very broad notion” as put forward \\nby Ukraine. He points out that,  in accordance with the notion of indirect discrimination, equal \\ntreatment can also constitute racial discrimination if it has an unjustifiable disproportionate \\nprejudicial impact on a protected group under CERD. \\nSeparate opinion of Judge Charlesworth \\n While agreeing with much of the Court’s reasoning and many of its conclusions, \\nJudge Charlesworth explains the points of her difference with the majority with respect to the \\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (“ICSFT”), the \\nInternational Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (“CERD”) and \\nthe Court’s Order of 19 April 2017 indicating provisional measures. \\n Judge Charlesworth t hinks that non-financial assets are not excluded from the concept of \\n“funds” under the ICSFT when they are used as means for the commission of offences under \\nArticle 2. Although she acknowledges that the ICSFT focuses on financial assets, she considers that \\nits scope is broader and covers non-financial assets even where they are not used for their monetary \\nor financial value. For Judge  Charlesworth, the contrary conclusion is counter -intuitive and \\ncomplicates the application of the ICSFT in practice, because it creates confusion as to the situations \\nin which the parties are to take action under the Convention. \\n Judge Charlesworth also points to the similarities between Article 9 of the ICSFT, which the \\nCourt finds to have been violated in the present case, a nd Article  12. In her view, the \\nRussian Federation was obliged to take action following Ukraine’s requests for legal assistance \\npursuant to Article  12. Judge  Charlesworth observes that the Russian  Federation’s response was \\n Turning to CERD, Judge  Charlesworth notes that the Court’s enquiry was framed following \\nUkraine’s claims. She emphasizes that individual acts of racial discrimination are wrongful under \\nCERD regardless of whether they form part of a pattern of racial discrimination, and she adds that a \\npattern of racial discrimination may emerge from a single measure affecting an undefined number of \\npersons. \\n Judge Charlesworth then discusses the concept of racial discrimin ation. Relying on the \\npractice of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and other international bodies, \\nshe explains that measures producing a disparate adverse effect must be explicable by an objective \\nand reasonable justification. In this connection, she considers that this justification must be subjected \\nto rigorous scrutiny and that, in particular, the measures in question ought to be applied pursuant to \\na legitimate aim and be proportional to the achievement of this aim. \\n Against th is background, Judge  Charlesworth considers that the Court’s assessment of \\nUkraine’s claims in the present case is not fully consistent. In relation to the Russian  Federation’s \\napplication of law enforcement measures, which produce a disparate adverse effect on Crimean \\nTatars, she takes account of reports of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. In \\nlight of those reports, Judge  Charlesworth thinks that the Russian Federation’s invocation of \\nconsiderations of security and public health does not suffice to justify the disparate adverse effect of \\nthese measures. Judge Charlesworth also criticizes the finding that the ban on the Mejlis is owing to \\nthe political activities carried out by some of its leaders, rather than on grounds of their ethnic origin. \\nIn her view, a common feature of measures is that they rely on a variety of justifications, therefore a \\nfinding that differential treatment is based on political grounds does not preclude it being also based \\non prohibited grounds under CERD. For Judge  Charlesworth, the Russian  Federation has not \\nsuccessfully discharged its burden of establishing that the ban on the Mejlis  is justified, because it \\nhas not convincingly explained why an outright ban of the entire institution was the appropriate \\nmeasure in the circumstances. \\n Judge Charlesworth then offers her views on the Court’s finding of a violation of the \\nprovisional measure concerning the non-aggravation of the dispute. According to \\nJudge Charlesworth, the obligation not to aggravate a dispute is a n aspect of the obligation to use \\nexclusively peaceful means for the settlement of disputes. Therefore, she argues, conduct that is \\nincompatible with the obligation of peaceful dispute settlement, such as the use of force, is in \\nprinciple likely to aggrava te a dispute pending before the Court. Judge  Charlesworth observes that \\nthe “special military operation” launched by the Russian  Federation since the Court’s Order entails \\nthe use of force, and she concludes that this conduct is incompatible with the oblig ation of \\nnon-aggravation. Judge Charlesworth explains that this finding does not concern the compatibility \\nof the Russian  Federation’s use of force with international law in general, but rather with the very \\nspecific obligation imposed on it under the term s of the Court’s Order. She adds that this finding is \\nwithout prejudice to the question as to whether Ukraine, to which the same measure was addressed, \\nalso failed to comply with it. \\n Finally, Judge  Charlesworth considers that the Russian  Federation has al so breached the \\nprovisional measure relating to ensuring the availability of education in the Ukrainian language. In \\nher view, this measure was aimed at mitigating the risk posed by documented restrictions that had \\nbeen imposed on the use of Ukrainian as a  language of instruction. Therefore, according to \\nJudge Charlesworth, this measure obliges the Russian Federation to ensure that students in Crimea \\nwishing to be educated in the Ukrainian language are able to do so. Relying on reports by the \\nSecretary-General, Judge Charlesworth finds that the availability of instruction in Ukrainian has not \\nalways satisfied demand, and therefore she concludes that the Russian  Federation has breached its \\nDéclaration de M. le juge Brant \\n Dans sa déclaration, le juge Brant explique les raisons pour lesquelles il ne peut pas se rallier \\nà la conclusion de la Cour selon laquelle la Fédération de Russie a violé l’ordonnance en indication \\nde mesures conservatoires du 19  avril 2017 en raison de l a mesure d’interdiction prise à l’encontre \\ndu Majlis. Il relève que la Cour est arrivée à la conclusion que les mesures prises par la Fédération \\nde Russie à l’encontre du Majlis n’emportent pas violation des obligations découlant de la CIEDR. \\nIl estime que la mesure telle qu’elle a été indiquée dans l’ordonnance du 19  avril 2017 s’en est \\ntrouvée dépourvue d’objet et qu’il n’y avait donc pas lieu pour la Cour d’accueillir la demande de \\nl’Ukraine tendant à faire constater une violation de l’ordonnance par la Fédération de Russie. \\nSeparate opinion of Judge ad hoc Pocar \\n In his partly dissenting opinion, Judge ad hoc Pocar disagrees with the Court’s methodological \\napproach to the interpretation of the term “funds” in the International Convention for the Suppression \\nof the Financing of Terrorism (hereinafter “ICSFT”). In particular, he criticizes the exclusion of \\nweapons and other objects used operatively in terrorist acts from the definition of “funds” as “assets \\nof every kind”. In his opinion, this exclusion creates an additional element of intent that has no basis \\nin the Convention. As a result, the Court refused to evaluate predicate acts the commission of which \\nwas sustained solely by the supply of weapons, including the shooting down of MH17. \\n Judge ad hoc Pocar also criticizes the Court’s analysis of the co -operation obligations under \\nArticles 10 and 12 of the ICSFT. He believes that the Russian Federation should have at least brought \\nUkraine’s requests to the attention of the relevant prosecutorial authorities in line with Article 10 of \\nthe ICFST, who should have then engaged in a preliminary inquiry into potential acts of terrorism \\nfinancing. He also dissents from the Court’s decision that the relevant requests for legal assistance \\ncited by Ukraine did not give rise to an obligation by the Russian Federation under Article 12 of the \\nICSFT to afford Ukraine “the greatest measure of assistance” in connection with the criminal \\ninvestigations in question. \\n Moreover, Judge ad hoc Pocar disagrees with the Court’s definition of racial discrimination \\nunder the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (hereinafter \\n“CERD”) set out in paragraph  196 of the Judgment. This paragraph suggests that prohibited \\ndiscrimination must always contain an in tentional element, whether concealed or not. In \\nJudge ad hoc Pocar’s view, requiring proof of discriminatory intent is inconsistent with the \\nConvention’s prohibition of conduct having a discriminatory effect. His partly dissenting opinion \\nalso emphasises that once a prima facie case of discrimination is established by demonstrating the \\ndisparate adverse impact on a group protected by the CERD, it is up to the Respondent to demonstrate \\nthat the measure in question was taken for a legitimate aim and in a proportionate manner. \\n Judge ad hoc Pocar points out that the Court failed to apply these principles correctly to the \\nban of the Mejlis , which, in his opinion, created an unjustified disparate impact on the rights of \\nCrimean Tatars and therefore constitutes a violation of the Russian Federation’s obligations under \\nthe CERD.  \\n Finally, Judge ad hoc Pocar notes that the protection of minority language education under the \\nCERD is broader than acknowledged by the Court in its Judgment. He dissents from the Judgment’s \\nconclusion that the Russian Federation has not violated the Court’s provisional measures Order of \\n2017 in relation to the availability of Ukrainian language education. In his view, a State cannot escape \\nan obligation to ensure the availability of langua ge education by artificially reducing demand, \\nSeparate opinion, partly concurring and partly dissenting, of Judge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov \\n In his partly concurring and partly dissenting separate opinion, Judge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov \\nexplains his reasons for dissenting and elaborates upon some of the issues not addressed in the \\nJudgment.  \\n Regarding the ICSFT, Judge ad hoc  Tuzmukhamedov observes  that the Court did not \\ndetermine with certainty that the attacks which took place in Donbass were attributable to the \\nDonbass forces. He also regrets that the Majority did not examine the incident involving the MH17 \\nmore deeply, as it could have found it was not the DPR responsible for it. However, Judge ad hoc \\nTuzmukhamedov concurs with the Majority’s view that there was a distinct lack of terrorist intent. \\nThe incidents that Ukraine cast as “acts of terrorism” occurred in the course of hostilities and \\ninvolved military targets. There was no intent to harm civilians, spread terror and the intent or \\nknowledge on behalf of an alleged financier that financing would go towards those goals was not \\npresent.  \\n Judge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov takes the view that the lack of proof of terrorism financing \\nshould have excluded violation of ancillary obligations to co-operate under Article 9 of the ICSFT. \\nIn his view, the Majority could not have found a breach of an obligation ancillary to the principal \\nobligation to combat terrorism financing when it had not been proven that terrorism financing took \\nplace at all. Judge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov is also of the opinion that the threshold adopted by the \\nCourt with regard to Article 9 of the ICSFT was far too low. He believes that Ukraine has presented \\nnothing but mere “allegations” of the commission of the offence under Article  2 of the ICSFT. \\nFinally, the Judge argues that, in any case, the Respondent did engage in adequate co-operation with \\nthe Applicant under Article 9. \\n Judge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov believes that the Majority was correct in finding absence of \\nviolation of Article 12 as the Ukrainian MLA requests did not explicitly refer to terrorism financing \\noffences or the ICSFT; Russia’s refusals to co-operate on several matters were legitimately based on \\nsovereignty as well as national security; and the circumstances prevailing in relations between the \\nParties justified such refusals. \\n Regarding the meaning of “funds”, Judge ad hoc  Tuzmukhamedov concurs with the view of \\nthe Majority. He believes that excluding weapons from the definition of “funds” is clear from the \\nordinary meaning of the term, the development history of the ICSFT, its structure and the context.  \\n In the view of Judge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov, all the requirements established in the Court’s \\nprevious jurisprudence were present for the Court to apply the “clean hands” doctrine with respect \\nto the ICSFT case, which it had missed.  \\n Turning to CERD, Judge ad hoc  Tuzmukhamedov believes that the Court properly found no \\nevidence of racial discrimination regarding the vast majority of Ukraine’s allegations. Moreover, he \\nagrees with the Majority that political views do not constitute an element of “ethnic origin” which \\nmust be a “characteristic acquired at birth”.  \\n Judge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov also opines that the ban on “Mejlis” does not constitute racial \\ndiscrimination. To him, the key factor of considering the ban lawful was its role in the blockade of \\nCrimea. It is regrettable th at the Court chose to neglect the United Nations OHCHR reports on the \\nhuman rights situation in Crimea which called attention to the action of “Mejlis” leadership together \\nwith Ukrainian neo -Nazi armed groups in organizing the blockade of trade routes and other \\ninfrastructure vital to the livelihood of Crimeans.  \\n According to Judge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov, the Court rightfully dismissed Ukraine’s concept \\nof “indirect discrimination”. In his view, Ukraine tried to advance a particularly broad interpretation \\n Judge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov strongly disagrees with the Majority’s view with respect to \\nschool education in the Ukrainian language. Since CERD does not contain a general right to school \\neducation in a minority language and a State is free in choice and scope of offer of school education \\nin minority languages, the Court should have concluded that there was no violation under CERD. In \\nthe absence of a protected right under CERD there cannot be racial discrimination with regard to the \\nexercise of that right. Moreover, Judge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov has a different view from that of the \\nMajority that a decline in numbers of parents choosing Ukrainian as a language in which their \\nchildren were to be educated could only result from a policy of racial discrimination imposed by \\nRussia. To him, it has occurred as an objective consequence of the Crimean population  — \\npredominantly Russians and Russian speakers — choosing Russian as language of school education. \\nIn addition to that, Judge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov observes that the Russian system of education \\nalready provides an opportunity to educate children in Ukrainian. For all these reasons, he believes \\nthat the Court reached a mistaken conclusion  with regard to language of school education and, to \\nmake matters worse, the remedies formulated by the Court are too imprecise.  \\n Like with the ICSFT, the circumstances were present for the Court to apply the doctrine of \\n“clean hands” to the CERD case, according to Judge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov. Ukraine has been \\nsystematically violating the rights of Russians and other ethnic groups. And yet the Majority opted \\nfor not engaging substantively with the facts cited by Russia. \\n Finally, Judge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov concurs with the Majority’s opinion that there was no \\nviolation of the provisional measures Order with regard to education in the Ukrainian language, \\nhowever, he disagrees with the decision regarding the ban on “Mejlis”. To him, from the very \\nbeginning the  measure in respect of “Mejlis” was ill -founded, but especially since the Court \\neventually found the ban not to be in contravention of CERD, the Applicant had no right that needed \\nto be protected and thus the Respondent could not have been found responsible for not protecting the \\nnon-existent or already successfully protected right. Regarding the measure on non-aggravation, in \\nthe opinion of Judge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov, the events of 2022 are beyond the scope of the dispute \\nbrought to the Court in 2017 and the provisional measure of non-aggravation should have ceased to \\nbe operative upon conclusion of the case. There had been no “aggravation” of the ICSFT/CERD \\ndispute. In addition to that, Judge ad hoc Tuzmukhamedov observes that the Court did not conform \\nto the principle of impartiality and equal treatment of the Parties since it did not even attempt to \\nexamine Ukraine’s compliance with the provisional measure of non-aggravation, as prescribed by \\nthe Order of 19 April 2017 addressed to both Parties.  \\n \\n___________ \\n \\n'},\n",

He claims that his return to India would constitute a violation by \\nCanada of article 3 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment. The complainant alleges lack of judicial control \\nrequired by the international human rights law on the administrative deportation decision \\nand that he did not have an effective remedy to challenge the deportation decision. The \\ncomplainant is represented by counsel, Mr. Stewart Istvanffy.  \\n1.2  In accordance with article 22, paragraph 3, of the Convention, the Committee \\nbrought the complaint to the State party’s attention by Note Verbale, dated 21 June 2007. \\nAt the same time, the Rapporteur for new complaints and interim measures requested the \\nState party not to deport the complainant to India while his case is under consideration by \\nthe Committee, in accordance with rule 108, paragraph 1, of the Committee's Rules of \\n 3 \\nprocedure.  The State party subsequently informed the Committee that the complainant had \\nnot been deported. \\nThe facts as presented by the complainant \\n2.1  The complainant is a baptized Sikh and was a part-time Sikh priest in the Indian \\nprovinces of Punjab and Haryana. Because of his preaching activities, frequent travel in the \\nregion and well-built body, he was questioned and harassed by the Indian police on several \\noccasions. The Indian police suspected him of being a terrorist or a sympathiser of the \\nmilitant organization Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) in India, as well as having helped \\nmilitants by sheltering them. He was detained twice on false accusations, the first time for \\nover three years from 1988 to 1991, and the second time in 1995.  \\n2.2 On 10 April 1988, officers of the Shahbad police station (Haryana province) arrested \\nthe complainant, his brother and three other individuals without explaining the reasons for \\ntheir arrest. At the police station the brothers were separated. The complainant was accused \\nof involvement in a murder in the city of Shahbad and of being associated with one Daya \\nSingh. The complainant denied the allegations. While in detention, the complainant was \\nseverely beaten and humiliated by the investigating officers and was forced to confess his \\nguilt. After three years of detention, the complainant and his brother were bailed out on 14 \\nMarch 1991 with a lawyer’s help. On 19 February 1998, the complainant was acquitted of \\nall charges related to the first accusation, but police officers continued to harass him under \\nthe pretext of visiting his home and place of religious services.  \\n2.3 On 14 September 1995, an inspector of the Kotwali police station (Punjab province) \\naccompanied by police officers, raided the complainant’s house and arrested him. The \\ncomplainant was handcuffed and his house was searched but no illegal items were \\ndiscovered. The complainant was taken to the interrogation room at the police station and \\nquestioned by the inspector about one Paramjit Singh, who allegedly was involved in the \\nassassination of the Punjab Chief Minister. The inspector alleged that the complainant had \\nsheltered Paramjit Singh at his house before the Chief Minister’s assassination. The \\ninspector also stated that he had received secret information from the Haryana police that \\nthe complainant was associated with KLF and that another militant had reported to the \\npolice having sent Paramjit Singh to stay with the complainant. To make him confess his \\nlinks with Paramjit Singh, the police subjected the complainant to the following forms of \\ntorture: a heavy wooden roller was rolled over his thighs with the legs spread apart; he was \\nhung upside down and administered electric shocks; his soles were beaten with wooden \\nrods, and he was not allowed to sleep. He was charged with harbouring a dangerous \\noffender but released on bail on 30 September 1995, with a lawyer’s help. The Patiala court \\nacquitted him of the above charges on 19 March 1997.\\n  \\n2.4 After his acquittal in both cases, the complainant became a member of the Sarab \\nHind Shiromani Akali Dal (Akali Dal), the main Punjabi nationalist party, and on 4 July \\n1999, he was appointed as a Secretary-General of Akali Dal in Haryana province. \\n2.5 Although acquitted, the police still wanted the complainant to identify Paramjit \\nSingh and two other individuals, who at that time were detained pending trial at the Burali \\njail. In 2000, he received three court summons, but the hearings were postponed each time. \\nAll this time the complainant was under police surveillance; he bribed the inspector to \\nfurther avoid it and moved to Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh province. There, he applied \\nfor a passport, which was subsequently issued by the Ghaziabad Passport Office in \\nSeptember 2002. \\n2.6 On 13 January 2003, the complainant was arrested in Uttar Pradesh province and \\nquestioned about his domicile and activities. He admitted to having a residence in two \\nplaces. Upon the request of Haryana police, he was transferred to Karnal on 15 January \\n4  \\n2003, where he again suffered torture before being released on 20 January 2003, with the \\nhelp of his parents and a prominent Akali Dal member.  \\n \\n2.7 On an unspecified date, after a Sikh function, the complainant was approached by an \\nindividual who was impressed by the service in the temple, in which the complainant was \\npreaching at that time, and invited him to come to Canada. On the basis on an invitation of \\na Sikh temple in British Columbia, the complainant received a Canadian visa on 16 \\nSeptember 2003 and arrived in Vancouver, Canada on 24 September 2003. While the \\ncomplainant was already in Canada, his father was arrested for three days, following the \\nescape of killers of the Punjab’s Chief Minister. Afterwards the complainant’s family was \\nconstantly harassed by police, in attempts to establish his whereabouts.   \\n2.8 After his arrival in Canada the complainant preached in two Sikh temples for a year \\nand a half on voluntary basis. He was promised by the management of the Canada based \\nGurudwara society that they will arrange his immigration status, but they failed to do so. \\n \\n2.9 The complainant travelled to Montreal where, on 28 March 2005, he filed an \\napplication for refugee status and protection. The complainant’s refugee claim was heard by \\nthe Immigration and Refugee Board (“the Board”) on 3 October 2005. On 16 November \\n2005, the Board determined that he was not a Convention refugee. The Board concluded \\nthat the applicant was not credible, that his behaviour was not remonstrative of a person \\nfearing for his life and that his departure related to the invitation by the Sikh religious \\ncommunity to work in Canada. \\n \\n2.10  The complainant applied to the Federal Court for leave to apply for judicial review \\nof the Board’s Decision, which was granted on 16 March 2006. The request for judicial \\nreview of this decision was heard on 7 June 2006 and it was denied by the Federal Court on \\n13 June 2006. The standard that the Federal Court applied to the credibility of the findings \\nof the Board was that of “patent reasonableness”. The Court concluded that the decision \\nwas not patently unreasonable, largely on grounds of the delay in claiming refugee status \\nafter arrival to the country and failure to provide credible or trustworthy evidence as to the \\ncomplainant’s background information in India.  \\n \\n2.11  After the refusal of refugee status and the decision from the Federal Court, on 27 \\nDecember 2006, the complainant filed an application for stay for humanitarian reasons, (so \\ncalled H&C application), submitting additional evidence under article 25(2) of the \\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act. The application was refused on 27 March 2007 \\nby a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) Officer who concluded that the applicant did \\nnot establish that he would be at risk should he return to India. The complainant applied to \\nthe Federal Court for leave to apply for judicial review of the H&C decision, which was \\ndismissed without reasons on 6 September 2007. \\n2.12 On 12 December 2006, the complainant submitted an application for protection from \\nCanada under the PRRA programme. On 27 March 2007, the latter was rejected by the \\nsame PRRA Officer who refused the H&C application. The motivation was that the \\ndocumentary evidence submitted by the complainant did not demonstrate that he might be \\nlisted or wanted by the Indian authorities; that the complainant had never claimed that he \\nwas a Sikh militant or a supporter of the militants; that he had not established that he held a \\nhigh profile, nor that he was a person of inte rest for the Indian authorities. Therefore, the \\nevidence submitted by the complainant did not corroborate that he might face a personal \\nand objectively identifiable risk should he return to India. \\n \\n 5 \\n2.13 After the PRRA application was refused, the complainant applied to the Federal \\nCourt for leave to apply for judicial review of the PRRA decision. The Federal Court \\ndismissed his application without reasons on 14 August 2007.  \\n2.14  On an unspecified date, the complainant applied to the Federal Court for a stay of \\nexecution of his removal order. A detailed affidavit about the present level of danger was \\nsubmitted with a motion for stay of deportation that was heard on 18 June 2007 and refused \\non 20 June 2007. The deportation of the complainant was scheduled for 21 June 2007.  \\nThe complaint \\n \\n3.1 The complainant contends that he has exhausted all available and effective domestic \\nremedies. \\n3.2 The complainant claims a violation of article 3  of the Convention against Torture by \\nCanada if he is to be deported to India in the light of the treatment suffered by him in police \\ncustody the past and continuing interest in him by the police in India.  \\n3.3 The complainant submits that Sikhs in India who are suspected of militant activities \\nare routinely arrested, tortured and murdered by police with impunity. He refers to the \\nreport on the situation of impunity published in the Harvard Human Rights Journal in 2002 \\n“A Judicial Blackout: \\nJudicial Impunity for Disappearances in Punjab”, which is claimed to be a leading authority \\non the current situation in Punjab. He further submits that as a result of being subjected to \\ntorture in the past, he suffers from post-trauma tic stress disorder, the diagnosis which is \\ncorroborated by medical reports from India and from Montreal. At the time of the \\nscheduled deportation there was an ongoing crisis in the Punjab and Haryana provinces. \\nThis crisis is said to have caused the central government to send large numbers of \\nparamilitaries to these two provinces. There had been a general strike and widespread \\nviolence in May and June 2007 among Sikhs and another religious sect. The complainant \\nclaims that individuals such as himself are routinely targeted by the police at the slightest \\nsign of political upheaval or disturbance.  \\n3.4 The complainant also states that he did not have an effective remedy to challenge the \\ndeportation decision as guaranteed in article 2 of the International Covenant for Civil and \\nPolitical Rights (ICCPR). He explains that the judicial review of the Immigration Board \\ndecision, denying him Convention refugee status, is not an appeal on the merits, but rather a \\nvery narrow review for gross errors of law. In the context of deportation these proceedings \\nhave no suspensive effect. The complainant also submits that the PRRA procedure of risk \\nanalysis is implemented by immigration agents who are not competent in matters of \\ninternational human rights and are not independent, impartial and do not possess recognised \\ncompetence in the matter. He claims that in the immigration department there is an \\nextremely negative attitude towards refugee claimants and that its decisions do not undergo \\nindependent scrutiny as required by the international human rights law. \\nState party’s observations on admissibility and the merits \\n \\n4.1  On 18 January 2008, the State party submitted observations on the admissibility and \\nthe merits of the communication.  \\n4.2 With regard to the allegation of violations of article 3 of the Convention, the State \\nparty maintains that the complaint is inadmissible pursuant to article 22, paragraph 2 of the \\nConvention and pursuant to Rule 107 (1)(b) and (d)of he Committee’s Rules of procedure, \\nas it is manifestly unfounded and incompatible with the Convention. The State party \\nsubmits that the complainant has failed to substantiate on a prima facie basis that there are \\nsubstantial grounds to believe that he personally faces a risk of torture on return to India. \\n6  \\nThe State party refers to the Committee's General Comment No.1, which states that it is the \\ncomplainant’s responsibility to establish a prima facie case for the purpose of admissibility \\nof his or her communication.  \\n4.3 The State party maintains that the communication is based on the same facts and \\nevidence as presented to the competent and impartial domestic tribunals and decision \\nmakers and emphasizes that it is not the role of the Committee to weigh evidence or \\nreassess findings of fact and credibility made by competent domestic decision-makers. The \\nState party submits that the complainant’s refugee claim was heard by the Immigration and \\nRefugee Board, which is an independent, quasi-judicial, specialized tribunal that hears \\nrefugee applications. The Board determined whether the person is a refugee based on an \\noral hearing and consideration of documentary evidence. The Board members are \\nspecialists in refugee law, who receive comprehensive, ongoing training and develop \\nexpertise on the human rights conditions in countries of alleged persecution. The State \\nparty submits that the Board’s decision was subject to judicial review by the Federal Court.  \\n4.4 The State party also submits that the complainant’s case was reviewed under the \\nPRRA programme, which is founded in Canada’s domestic and international commitments \\nto the principle of non-refoulement.  Under this procedure an applicant whose claim to \\nrefugee protection has been rejected by the Board may present for consideration only new \\nevidence that arose after the rejection or was not reasonably available, or that the applicant \\ncould not reasonably have been expected to have presented, at the time of the rejection. \\nPRRA applications are considered by officers specially trained to assess risk and to \\nconsider the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms as well as Canada’s international \\nobligations, including those under the Convention against Torture. The State party also \\nmakes reference to the complainant’s unsuccessful H&C application. The State party makes \\nreference to previous decisions of the Committee and other United Nation treaty bodies, \\nwhich have considered the judicial review\\n1 and PRRA process2 to be effective remedies. \\n4.5 The State party refers to the Committee’s constant view that it can not review \\ncredibility findings unless it can be demonstrated that such findings are arbitrary or \\nunreasonable; that the complainant has made no such allegations nor does the submitted \\nmaterial support a finding that the Board’s decision suffered from such defects. \\n \\n4.6 The State party refers to the complainant’s claims that the Canadian refugee \\ndetermination and post-determination process were insufficient and did not meet \\ninternational human rights standards. The State party submits that these allegations fail to \\ndescribe in sufficient detail how the above procedure violates article 3 or any other \\nprovision of the Convention or fail to provide for an effective remedy. It also notes that it is \\nnot within the scope of review of the Committee to consider the Canadian system in \\ngeneral, but only to examine whether, in the present case, the State party complied with its \\nobligations under the Convention. The State Party maintains that the allegation of lack of \\neffective remedy should be found inadmissible since it constitutes an allegation for \\nviolation of article 2 (3) of ICCPR and therefore it is not within the Committee’s \\njurisdiction under article 22, paragraph 1 of the Convention. \\n \\n \\n                         1 P.S.S v.

Canada, \\nCommunication 604/1994, para 6.2, Badu v. Canada, Communication 603/1994, para 6.2, Khan v. \\nCanada, Communication 1302/2004, para 5.5. \\n 7 \\n4.7  The State party maintains that the complainant has failed to show that he is \\npersonally at substantial risk of torture if returned to India. The State party submits that the \\ncomplainant’s credibility is highly suspect, that his overall behaviour was not \\ndemonstrative of someone who fears persecution or serious harm; that there are no credible \\nreasons to consider that he fits the personal profile of someone who would be of interest to \\nthe Indian authorities; that the general human rights situation in the country cannot by itself \\nbe sufficient to establish that the complainant would be personally at risk if returned; and \\nthat the current human rights situation in India does not support the complainant’s \\nallegations of risk.  \\n4.8 Should the Committee be inclined to assess the complainant’s credibility, the State \\nparty submits that a number of key issues clearly supports a finding that the complainant’s \\nstory can not be believed: the complainant’s one year and a half delay in making a refugee \\nclaim and the reasons cited for it significantly detract from his credibility; the \\ncomplainant’s allegation that he feared harm is not plausible since he waited many months \\nafter receiving a passport before leaving India; there were inconsistencies in the author’s \\nallegations of political involvement- namely he was unable to provide details of Akali Dal \\nparty’s ideology and failed to explain how he could continue to act as General Secretary of \\nthe  Haryana Unit after leaving the geographic area. \\n4.9 The State party also submits that objective evidence does not corroborate the \\ncomplainant’s allegations with regard to the human right situation in India. It states that the \\nhuman rights situation for Sikhs in Punjab and India has improved to the extent that there is \\nnot a significant risk of torture or other ill-treatment on the part of the police, and that only \\nthose considered to be high-profile militants may still be at risk and refers to several reports \\nin support of that view. \\n4.10  The State party maintains that the complainant has failed to show in his submissions \\nthat he would be unable to lead a life free of torture in another part of India and makes \\nreference to the previous practice of the Committee that while the complainant may face \\nhardship should he not be able to return to his home, such hardship would not amount to \\ntorture or ill-treatment. \\n3 \\n4.11 In the event the Committee determines that the complainant’s communication is \\nadmissible, the State party requests that the communication be found without merit. \\n \\nComplainant’s comments on the State party’s observations on the admissibility and the merits \\n \\n5.1  The complainant submits in support of his communication a report prepared by the \\nPunjab Human Rights Organization, regarding his case. He also notes that the State party \\ndoes not seriously question that he had been targeted and subjected to torture in the past. \\n5.2 In a separate submission, the complainant underlines that the Federal Court of \\nCanada is not effecting a real control over the immigration authorities when they look at \\nstays of deportation, since the Court has established jurisprudence that if the Board decided \\na refugee claimant is not credible, than their story can not be a base for stopping their \\ndeportation, even when there is substantial evidence of an error in judgment. The \\ncomplainant quotes cases where the Federal Court has consistently decided that the \\ndecisions of the Immigration Board are discretionary and that the Court should not \\nintervene except if the immigration officer exercises his discretion pursuant to “improper \\n \\n \\n                         3 B.S.S v. Canada, Communication 183/ 2001 (2004), para11.5; S.S.S. v. Canada, Communication \\n245/2004 (2005), para 8.5. \\n8  \\npurposes, irrelevant considerations, with bad faith, or in a patently unreasonable manner.” 4 \\nHe maintains that when the judicial recourse is futile and in cases where there are \\nsubstantial grounds to intervene the Court does not even hear the case and that this is not a \\nrecourse that is effective and efficient following the recognized principles of the \\ninternational law. The complainant claims that no human rights organizations dealing with \\nrefugees have any confidence in the PRRA as an effective recourse to protect victims of \\nviolations and refers to several documents in support of his view.  \\n5.3 The complainant maintains that the State party’s authorities are following a political \\nline of refusing asylum to Sikh victims of torture from India. He states that the rate of \\nacceptance of PRRA cases is 3% for Canada and only 1% in Quebec, where his case was \\nreviewed. He further submits that most applicants are refused with identical motivation.  \\n5.4 The complainant further submits that, even though Sikhs are not a targeted group, \\nthere are Sikhs who are targeted because of their political activities or their efforts to get \\njustice for human rights abuses. He maintains that, according to Indian human rights \\ngroups, arbitrary arrests are happening all the time and individuals who were at risk in the \\npast are still at risk. He maintains that there are no valid legal recourses for victims of \\nhuman rights abuses in India and refers to the submitted article in the Harvard Human \\nRights Law Journal.  \\n5.5 The complainant contests the suggestion that he could relocate and live in safety \\nelsewhere in India, again refers to the article in the Harvard Human Rights Law Journal and \\nstates that individuals have been detained for not reporting to the police. He also contests \\nthe State party’s assertion that there would be no immediate danger for him upon arrival in \\nIndia and states that there have been cases of individuals detained upon arrival at the airport \\nand taken to prison, where they were tortured. Further, he contests that only high profile \\nindividuals are at risk of torture and refers to a 2003 Amnesty International report which \\ndemonstrates how deeply ingrained is the system of torture and abuse. He is also referring \\nto pages 25-28 of the Danish Immigration Service Report on Fact- finding Mission to \\nPunjab, India, 21 March to 5 April 2000 , where widespread torture and deaths in police \\ncustody are described.  \\n5.6 The complainant submits that he is personally at risk of torture if returned to India \\nbecause: he had previously been accused of participation in militant activities in 1988 and \\nin 1995; he was detained for three and a half years between 1988 and 1991 and subjected to \\ntorture while in detention and previous detainees for militant activities are one of the main \\nrisk groups according to human rights reports; he was a prominent Sikh priest at some of \\nthe most important Sikh temples in Punjab and Haryana and therefore is a high-profile \\nfigure, since prominent Sikh religious figures are among the most targeted figures by the \\nsecurity services; he was a prominent figure in the Akai Dal in Haryana; he has personal \\nfamily links with well known militants, as confirmed by the submitted report of the Punjab \\nHuman Rights Organization. \\n5.7 The complainant contests the State party’s assertion that the torture with impunity in \\nIndia has ended and in support describes several cases where human rights defenders or \\nactivists of Akali Dal have been detained and tortured by the police.  He also maintains that \\nafter the 2008 Mumbai attacks there was a great wave of detentions, false accusations and \\ntorture taking place against large parts of the political class. The complainant also refers to \\nthe 2005 report of the Organization ENSAAF, entitled Punjab Police: Fabricating \\nTerrorism through Illegal Detention and Torture , which talks about large quantity of \\n \\n \\n                   4 Case of Amir Shahin Sokhan, Imm-3067-96, 7 July 1997. Similar jurisprudence quoted from the \\ncase of  Rahmatollah Khayambashi, Imm-1246-98, 7 January 1999. \\n 9 \\narbitrary detentions in the period June-August 2005, including a leader of Akali Dal. He \\nsubmits that his political activities would make him particularly vulnerable to detention and \\ntorture if he were to be returned.  \\n6.1  By Note Verbale of 17 July 2009, the State party submits that the Fact-Finding \\nReport Regarding Nirmal Singh,  presented by the complainant, contains no new evidence \\ndemonstrating that there were substantial grounds to believe that the latter would personally \\nbe at risk of torture if returned to India.  \\n \\n \\n6.2  Should it be determined that the report contains new evidence, the State party \\nsubmits that the complainant should present it first to Canadian immigration authorities, \\nthat the complainant has not exhausted domestic remedies as required by article 22 (5)(b) of \\nthe Convention and therefore it is inadmissible. The State party notes that it remains open \\nto the complainant to request a new PRRA or file a new H&C application for permanent \\nresidence based on the new report. \\n \\n6.3 In conclusion, the State party continues to rely on their original submission of 17 \\nJanuary 2007 and asks the Committee to find the communication inadmissible and lacking \\nin merits. \\n \\nIssues and proceedings before the Committee \\n  Consideration of admissibility \\n7.1 Before considering any claims contained in a communication, the Committee against \\nTorture must decide whether or not it is admissible under article 22 of the Convention. The \\nCommittee has ascertained, as it is required to do under article 22, paragraph 5 (a), that the \\nsame matter has not been, and is not being, examined under another procedure of \\ninternational investigation or settlement and that all available domestic remedies have been \\nexhausted. \\n \\n7.2 The Committee notes the State party's contention that the complaint of a violation of \\narticle 3 of the Convention, based on the return of the complainant to India is manifestly \\nunfounded and therefore inadmissible. The Committee, however, considers that the \\ncomplainant has provided sufficient substantiation to permit it to consider the case on the \\nmerits.  \\n \\n7.3 The Committee notes the State party’s submission that the allegation of lack of \\neffective remedy should be found inadmissible since it constitutes an allegation for \\nviolation of article 2 (3) of ICCPR and therefore it is not within the Committee’s \\njurisdiction under article 22, paragraph 1 of the Convention. The Committee, however, \\nrecalls its jurisprudence that the prohibition on refoulement should be interpreted to \\nencompass a remedy for its breach.\\n5 \\n \\n  \\n  5 See Ahmed Hussein Mustafa, complaint No. 233/2003, Views of 20 of May 2005, para. 13.6 and \\n13.7. \\n10  \\n7.4 Accordingly, the Committee decides that the complaint is admissible as pleaded in \\nrespect of the alleged violations of article 3 of the Convention. \\nConsideration of the merits \\n \\n8.1 The Committee must evaluate whether there are substantial grounds for believing \\nthat the complainant would be personally in danger of being subjected to torture upon \\nreturn to India.  \\n8.2 The Committee notes the State party's argument that the human rights situation in \\nthe Punjab and in India has improved and stabilized in recent years. It observes, however, \\nthat reports submitted both by the complainant and the State party, confirm inter alia that \\nnumerous incidents of torture in police custody continue to take place, and that there is \\nwidespread impunity for perpetrators. The Committee observes that the existence of a \\nconsistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights in a country does not \\nas such constitute a sufficient ground for determining that a particular person was in danger \\nof being subjected to torture upon his return to that country; additional grounds must exist \\nto show that the individual concerned was personally at risk.\\n6 \\n8.3 The Committee notes that State party’s submission that it is not the role of the \\nCommittee to weigh evidence or reassess findings of fact and credibility made by \\ncompetent domestic decision-makers. According to the General Comment No. 1, paragraph \\n9, the Committee gives “considerable weight (…) to findings of fact that are made by \\norgans of the State party concerned (…) but the Committee is not bound by such findings \\nand instead has the power, provided by article 22, paragraph 4, of the Convention, of free \\nassessment of the facts based upon the full set of circumstances in every case”. The \\nCommittee notes that in the case under analysis, most of the facts are undisputed by the \\nparties, however the assessment of the legal consequences of the relevant facts are \\nchallenged. In this situation, the Committee should assess the facts in light of the State \\nparty’s obligations under the Convention.  \\n8.4 The Committee observes that the complainant submitted evidence in support of his \\nclaims that he was tortured during detention on at least three occasions, in 1988, 1995 and \\n2003, including medical reports, as well as written testimony corroborating these \\nallegations. It also notes the medical reports from clinics in India and Canada, which \\nconclude that there is sufficient objective physical and psychological evidence \\ncorroborating his subjective account of torture and that the State party has not contested the \\ncomplainant’s allegations that he had been subjected to torture in the past.  \\n8.5  The Committee notes the State party’s submission that the complainant has failed to \\ndemonstrate that he is a “high profile” person and therefore that he would be of interest for \\nthe Indian authorities. However, the Committee notes that the complainant contends he was \\ndetained and tortured because he was accused of being a militant, that despite his formal \\nacquittal by the courts, the police continued to harass him, that he is well known to the \\nauthorities because of his activities as a Sikh priest, his political involvement with Akali \\nDal party and his leadership role in the local structures of the party. The Committee \\nobserves that the complainant has provided documentary evidence that he has a history of \\nbeing investigated and prosecuted as an alleged Sikh militant, that he was appointed as \\nSecretary General of the Haryana unit of the Akali Dal party and that he served as a Sikh \\npriest. The Committee accordingly considers that the complainant has provided sufficient \\nevidence that his profile is sufficiently high to put him at risk of torture if arrested. \\n \\n \\n                         6 See A.M. v. France, complaint No. 302/2006, Views of 5 May 2010, para 13.2; S.P.A. v. Canada,  \\n                            complaint No. 282/2005, Views of 7 November 2006, para 7.1. \\n 11 \\n \\n8.6  The Committee notes the State party’s submission that the complainant has failed to \\nshow in his submissions that he would be unable to lead a life free of torture in another part \\nof India. The Committee, however, observes that the complainant has submitted evidence \\nthat he had been arrested in three different provinces - Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. \\nThe Committee also takes note of the evidence submitted that the Indian police continued \\nto look for the complainant and to question his family about his whereabouts long after he \\nhad fled to Canada. In light of these considerations, the Committee does not consider that \\nhe would be able to lead a life free of torture in other parts of India. \\n8.7 In the light of the foregoing, the Committee concludes that the complainant has \\nestablished a personal, present and foreseeable risk of being tortured if he were to be \\nreturned to India. \\n8.8  The complaint states that he did not have an effective remedy to challenge the \\ndecision on deportation and that the judicial review of the Immigration Board decision, \\ndenying him Convention refugee status, was not an appeal on the merits, but rather a very \\nnarrow review for gross errors of law. The State party in response submits that the Board’s \\ndecision was subject to judicial review by the Federal Court. The Committee notes that \\naccording to Section 18.1(4) of the Canadian Federal Courts Act , the Federal Court may \\nquash a decision of the Immigration Refugee Board if satisfied that: the tribunal acted \\nwithout jurisdiction; failed to observe a principle of natural justice or procedural fairness; \\nerred in law in making a decision; based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact; acted, \\nor failed to act, by reason of fraud or perjured evidence; or acted in any other way that was \\ncontrary to law. The Committee observes that none of the grounds above include a review \\non the merits of the complainant’s claim that he would be tortured if returned to India.  \\n8.9 With regard to the PRPA procedure of risk analysis, to which the complainant also \\nsubjected his claim, the Committee notes that according to the State party’s submission, \\nPRRA submissions may only include new evidence that arose after the rejection of the \\nrefugee protection claim; further, the PRRA decisions are subject to a discretionary leave to \\nappeal, which was denied in the case of the complainant. The Committee refers to its \\nConcluding observations (CAT/C/CR/34/CAN of 7 July 2005, para 5 (c)), that the State \\nparty should provide for judicial review of the merits, rather than merely of the \\nreasonableness, of decisions to expel an individual where there are substantial grounds for \\nbelieving that the person faces a risk of torture\\n7. The Committee accordingly concludes that \\nin the instant case the complainant did not have access to an effective remedy against his \\ndeportation to India, in violation of article 22 of the Convention against Torture. \\n9. The Committee against Torture, acting under article 22, paragraph 7, of the \\nConvention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \\nPunishment, considers that the State party's decision to return the complainant to India, if \\nimplemented would constitute a breach of article 3 of the Convention. The Committee also \\nconsiders that in the instant case the lack of an effective remedy against the deportation \\ndecision constitutes a breach of article 22 of the Convention.  \\n10. In conformity with article 112, paragrap h 5, of its rules of procedure, the Committee \\nwishes to be informed, within 90 days, on the steps taken by the State party to respond to \\nthese Views. \\n[Adopted in English, French, and Spanish, the English text being the original version. \\nSubsequently to be issued also in Arabic, Russian and Chinese as part of the Committee’s \\nannual report to the General Assembly.] \\n \\n \\n  7 See T.I. v.

In 2012, M was charged \\nwith two counts of attempted murder and two counts of discharging a firearm following \\nan argument with a man in a bar during which M fired a gun. The charges were \\neventually staye d because of delay. In unrelated incidents, D was alleged to have \\nengaged in acts of violence against intimate partners and other persons. Some of the \\ncriminal charges flowing from these incidents were stayed and he pled guilty to three \\ncharges and received a conditional discharge.  \\n Following these incidents, inadmissibility reports were prepared alleging \\nthat both M and D were inadmissible to Canada on “security grounds” under s. 34(1)(e) \\nof the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act  (“IRPA”), which provi des that a \\npermanent resident or foreign national is inadmissible for “engaging in acts of violence \\nthat would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada”. The reports \\nwere referred to the Immigration Division (“ID”) for admissibility hearings. It was not \\nalleged that either M or D engaged in acts of violence with a link to national security \\nor the security of Canada. In M’s case, the ID ruled that a “security ground” under \\ns. 34(1) means a threat to the security of Canada or another country, and that the act of \\nviolence in question must have some connection to a threat to the security of Canada. \\nAs M’s alleged conduct lacked any element that would elevate it to security grounds, \\n \\nallowed the Minister’s appeal and concluded that inadmissibility under s.  34(1)(e) \\nrelated to security in a broader sense, namely, to ensure that individual Canadians are \\nsecure from acts of violence that would or might endanger their lives or safety. In D’s \\ncase, the ID followed the IAD’s interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) in M’s case, concluded \\nthat D was inadmissible, and issued a deportation order. \\n The Federal Court allowed M and D’s applications for judicial review, \\nruling that it wa s unreasonable to interpret s.  34(1)(e) as applying to acts of violence \\nwithout a nexus to national security. In both cases, the Federal Court certified, under \\ns. 74(d) of the IRPA, the following serious question of general importance for appeal \\nto the Federal Court of Appeal: Is it reasonable to interpret s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA in a \\nmanner that does not require proof of conduct that has a nexus with “national security” \\nor “the security of Canada”? The Federal Court of Appeal allowed the Minister’s \\nappeals, holding that the IAD in M’s case and ID in D’s case had reasonably interpreted \\ns. 34(1)(e) as not requiring a nexus to national security or the security of Canada. \\n Held: The appeals should be allowed. In M’s appeal, the IAD decision \\nshould be quashed. I n D’s appeal, the ID decision and deportation order should be \\nquashed.  \\n Per Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and \\nO’Bonsawin JJ.: Applying the Vavilov framework to the instant appeals, the \\nappropriate standard of review of the adm inistrative decisions is reasonableness. No \\n \\nany new exception be created on the basis that the appeals involved a serious question \\nof general importance certified for appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal. In the instant \\ncases, both administrative decisions were unreasonable. The relevant legal constraints \\npoint overwhelmingly to a single reasonable interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) — a person \\ncan be found inadmissible under s. 34(1)(e) only if they engage in acts of violence with \\na nexus to national security or the security of Canada. \\n In Vavilov, the Court established a presumption that when a court reviews \\nthe merits of an administrative decision, the standard of review is reasonableness. This \\npresumption is rebutted in two types of situations — where the legislature has indicated \\nthat it intends a different standard or set of standards to apply or where the rule of law \\nrequires that the standard of correctness be applied — which together provide six \\ncategories of correctness review. The first situation provides for two categories of \\ncorrectness review: when the legislature explicitly prescribes the standard of review, \\nand when it provides for an appeal from an administrative decision to a court. With \\nrespect to the second situation, Vavilov sets out three categories of questions that the \\nrule of law requires to be reviewed on a standard of correctness: constitutional \\nquestions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole, \\nand questions related to the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more \\nadministrative bodies. A sixth category of correctness review was recognized by the \\nCourt in Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Cana da v. \\nEntertainment Software Association , 2022 SCC 30: when courts and administrative \\n \\n None of the established exceptions to the presumption of reasonableness \\nreview appli es in the instant cases: the legislature has not explicitly prescribed the \\nstandard of review or provided a statutory appeal mechanism from an administrative \\ndecision to a court, and the standard of correctness is not required based on the rule of \\nlaw. The proper interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) of the IRPA is not a general question of \\nlaw of central importance to the legal system as a whole. Although it is important for \\nthe affected persons and the proper administration of the IRPA, it does not affect the \\nlegal system or the administration of justice as a whole, have legal implications for \\nmany other statutes, or affect other institutions of government; rather, the issues raised \\nare particular to the interpretation of the conditions for inadmissibility under \\ns. 34(1)(e). Moreover, the proper interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) is not a constitutional \\nquestion or a question related to the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more \\nadministrative bodies, nor does it engage the correctness category recognized in Society \\nof Composers. \\n The certified question regime under s. 74(d) of the IRPA does not displace \\nthe presumption of reasonableness review and warrant a new category of correctness. \\nThe Federal Court’s certification of a question for appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal \\nprovides for a statutory appeal of the Federal Court’s decision to the Federal Court of \\nAppeal, but it does not change the standard of review to be applied by either court. \\nFirst, the Federal Court’s decision to certify a serious question of ge neral importance \\nunder s. 74(d) does not affect the standard of review to be applied by the Federal Court \\n \\ngatekeeping role by requiring that the matter meet a threshold of importance to merit \\nan appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal. The certified question may be the trigger by \\nwhich an appeal is permitted, but the subject of the appeal is still the judgment itself, \\nnot merely the certified question. Thus, the certified question regime does not amount \\nto rare and exceptional circumstances in which the Federal Court applying \\nreasonableness review would undermine legislative intent or the rule of law in a manner \\nanalogous to the existing correctness categories.  \\n Second, the certification of a serious question of general importance does \\nnot require correctness review by the Federal Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. \\nAs a matter of precedent, the Court has concluded in the immigration context that \\ndespite the presence of a certified question, the standard of review is reasonableness. \\nVavilov does not require that conclusion to be revisited. Certification of a question does \\nnot signal that the legislature intended that appellate courts apply correctness review. \\nThe Federal Court of Appeal’s task in an appeal from a decision of the Federal Court \\nin an application for judicial review is to determine whether the Federal Court identified \\nthe appropriate standard of review and then to decide whether it applied that standard \\nproperly. The certified question regime neither rebuts the presumption of \\nreasonableness, nor alters the Court of Appeal’s task when it hears appeals from first \\ninstance judicial review decisions. Moreover, recognizing a new correctness category \\nin the instant cases would conflict with Vavilov’s goal of simplifying and making more \\npredictable the standard of review framework by providing only limited exceptions to \\n \\n Vavilov provided extensive guidance on conducting reasonableness review \\nof administrative decisions. Although the Federal Court in M’s case did not have the \\nbenefit of Vavilov, the Federal Court of Appeal did, and it  strayed from Vavilov’s \\nmethodology of reasonableness review. It grafted onto Vavilov an extra step of \\nconducting a preliminary analysis of the text, context, and purpose of the legislation to \\nunderstand the lay of  the land before examining the administrative decisions. This \\npreliminary step is inconsistent with Vavilov. Vavilov is clear that a reviewing court \\nmust start its analysis with the reasons of the administrative decision maker. Starting \\nwith its own perception of the merits may lead a court to slip into correctness review. \\n The administrative decision s under review did not reasonably interpret \\ns. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA by not requiring a nexus with national security or the security \\nof Canada. Vavilov instructed that a reviewing court should conduct reasonableness \\nreview mindful of the impact of the decision on the affected  individual. According to \\nthe principle of responsive justification, where the impact of a decision on an \\nindividual’s rights and interests is severe, the reasons provided to that individual must \\nreflect the stakes. In the instant cases, the interpretation  of s.  34(1)(e) will affect \\nwhether two individuals could be deported from Canada. The IAD’s reasons had to \\nreflect these stakes. However, the IAD’s reasons in M’s case failed to address critical \\npoints of statutory context and the broad consequences of it s interpretation of \\ns. 34(1)(e) that were raised by M. These omissions were significant, involved a failure \\nof responsive justification and, cumulatively, rendered the IAD’s decision \\n \\nCanada’s obligation of non-refoulement under Article 33(1) of the 1951  Convention \\nRelating to the Status of Refugees, contrary to the express direction in s. 3(3)(f) of the \\nIRPA that it must do so. The ID’s decision in D’s case, which simply  followed the \\nIAD’s interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) of the IRPA in M’s case, was unreasonable for the \\nsame reasons. \\n Cumulatively, the relevant legal constraints point overwhelmingly to only \\none reasonable interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) — the provision requires a nexus to national \\nsecurity or the security of Canada. Section 34(1)(e) can be invoked to render a person \\ninadmissible only when their “acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives \\nor safety of persons in Canada” have a nexus with national s ecurity or the security of \\nCanada. Because the Minister has not alleged that M or D engaged in acts of violence \\nwith a link to national security or the security of Canada, s.  34(1)(e) of the IRPA does \\nnot provide a legal basis for the inadmissibility of either person.  \\n Per Côté J.: There is agreement with the majority’s disposition of the \\nappeals, its finding that the IAD’s interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) was unreasonable and its \\ndetermination that inadmissibility under s.  34(1)(e) of the IRPA requires a nex us \\nbetween the relevant act of violence and with national security or the security of \\nCanada. However, the IAD’s interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) should be reviewed on a \\nstandard of correctness. \\n Section 74(d) of the IRPA provides for an exceptional appeal to the Federal \\n \\nThis indicates legislative intent for judicial involvement and a desire to subject these \\nparticular questions, as distinct from all others arising under the IRPA more broadly, to \\nappellate standards of review. Questions certified under s.  74(d) will, by definition, \\nhave implications beyond the immediate parties and raise issues of broad significance \\nwithin Canada’s immigration and refugee protection scheme.  \\n In Vavilov, the Court held that the categories of correctness review are not \\nclosed but that reviewing courts should only derogate from the presumption of \\nreasonableness review where required by a clear indication of legislative intent \\n(legislated standards of review and statutory appeal mechanisms) or the rule of law \\n(constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal \\nsystem as a whole, and questions regarding jurisdictional boundaries between \\nadministrative bodies). The presumption of reasonableness review  from Vavilov does \\nnot apply where the legislature expressly involves the court in the administrative \\nscheme. To say that Vavilov is determinative and that the standard of review for \\ncertified questions is reasonableness would contradict the Vavilov framework itself.  \\n To be consistent with the principles and framework set out in Vavilov, a \\nnew category of correctness review should be recognized: when appellate courts decide \\na serious question of general importance ce rtified under s. 74(d) of the IRPA. For the \\ncertified question regime to be given its explicitly legislated scope, appellate courts \\nmust be able to answer them correctly. Reasonableness review of certified questions \\n \\nrule of law requires — and Parliament intended for appellate courts to provide — a \\nsingular, determinate and final answer to a question certified as a serious question of \\ngeneral importance under the IRPA. Even a robust form of reasonableness review may \\nbe insufficient to guard against the risk, and the c onsequences, of arbitrariness. By \\ndefinition, certified questions transcend the interests of the parties and raise issues of \\nbroad significance and general impo rtance within Canada’s immigration and refugee \\nprotection scheme. These are the exact types of questions for which the rule of law \\ndemands consistent and definitive answers — and for which the risk of arbitrariness is \\nunacceptable. For serious questions of  general importance arising under the IRPA, \\nParliament did not intend courts to be forced to defer to administrative decisions that \\nmay be reasonable, but are wrong in law. The only way s.  74(d) of the IRPA can be \\ngiven its explicitly legislated scope is if appellate courts are permitted to substitute their \\nown opinion in respect of these serious questions of general importance. The certified \\nquestion regime would be incoherent if the standard of review were anything other than \\ncorrectness.  \\n The IAD’s inte rpretation of s.  34(1)(e) was unreasonable and \\ninadmissibility under s. 34(1)(e) requires a nexus between the relevant act of violence \\nand with national security or the security of Canada. The IAD’s interpretation would \\nsignificantly expand the grounds on which foreign nationals or permanent residents \\nmay be deported from Canada. It would allow foreign nationals to be returned to \\ncountries where they may face persecution, in a manner contrary to Canada’s \\n \\nintend for appellate courts to defer to reasonable but legally incorrect answers to this \\nor other certified questions. It remains the task of administrative decision makers under \\nthe IRPA to apply this interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) going forward, including \\ndetermining which acts of violence may indeed qualify as a threat to national security \\nor the security of Canada. \\nCases Cited \\nBy Jamal J. \\n Applied: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Im migration) v.

Overview \\n[1] These appeals require the Court to apply the framework for judicial review \\ndeveloped in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC \\n65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, to two administrative decisions involving a question of \\nstatutory interpretation in the immigration context. \\n[2] The statutory provision at issue, s. 34(1)(e) of the Immigration and Refugee \\nProtection Act , S.C. 2001, c. 27 (“ IRPA”), provides that permanent residents and \\nforeign nationals are inadmissible to Canada on “security grounds” for “engaging in \\nacts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada”. \\nThe key point of disagreement among the administrative decision makers and courts \\n \\nrequire a link to national security or the security of Canada, or whether s.  34(1)(e) \\napplies to acts of violence more broadly even without such a link. \\n[3] Both administrative decisions under review interpreted s.  34(1)(e) as not \\nrequiring the acts of violence to have a link to national security or the security of \\nCanada. In the first administrative decision, the Immigration Appeal Division (“IAD”) \\nof the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (“IRB”) ruled that Mr. Earl Mason, \\na foreign national, could be found inadmissible under s.  34(1)(e) if his alleged violent \\nconduct were estab lished. Mr. Mason allegedly shot a gun and wounded two people \\nwhen he was assaulted during a fight at a bar. Charges against him were stayed and he \\nwas not convicted of any criminal offence. In the second administrative decision, the \\nImmigration Division (“ID”) of the IRB followed the IAD’s interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) \\nin Mr. Mason’s case and ruled that Mr. Seifeslam Dleiow, a foreign national, was \\ninadmissible under s. 34(1)(e) for acts of violence against two intimate partners. It was \\nnot alleged that either Mr. Mason or Mr. Dleiow engaged in acts of violence with a link \\nto national security or the security of Canada. \\n[4] The Federal Court allowed Mr.  Mason and Mr. Dleiow’s applications for \\njudicial review. In Mr.  Mason’s case, in reasons released before this Court released \\nVavilov, the Federal Court ruled that it was unreasonable to interpret s.  34(1)(e) as \\napplying to act s of violence without a nexus to national security. The Federal Court \\nfollowed that approach in Mr. Dleiow’s case. Thus, neither Mr. Mason nor Mr. Dleiow \\n \\ngeneral importance, so that the Federal Court of Appeal could consider whether it was \\nreasonable to interpret s. 34(1)(e) as not requiring proof of conduct having a nexus to \\nnational security or the security of Canada. \\n[5] The Federal Court of Appeal allowed both appeals. In  reasons addressing \\nboth cases — released after this Court released Vavilov — the Court of Appeal ruled \\nthat the IAD and ID had reasonably interpreted s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA as not requiring \\na nexus to national security or the security of Canada. \\n[6] Mr. Mason and Mr.  Dleiow now appeal to this Court. Two issues arise. \\nFirst, what standard of review should the reviewing courts have applied when \\nreviewing the decisions of the IAD in Mr. Mason’s case and the ID in Mr. Dleiow’s \\ncase? Second, how should that standa rd of review have been applied in the \\ncircumstances? \\n[7] In Vavilov, this Court revised the framework for determining the standard \\nof review. The Court established a presumption that the standard of review of the merits \\nof an administrative decision is reasonableness, subject to limited exceptions based on \\nlegislative intent or when required by the rule of law (paras.  10 and 17). The revised \\nframework seeks to maintain the rule of law, while respecting a legislature’s intent to \\nentrust certain decisions to administrative decision makers rather than courts (paras. 2 \\nand 14). It also aims to bring simplicity, coherence, and predictability to the law on the \\nstandard of review and to eliminate the unwieldy exercise of determining the standard \\n \\njurisprudence following Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick , 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. \\n190 (Vavilov, at paras. 7 and 10). \\n[8] Vavilov also explained how a court should conduct reasonableness review. \\nThis Court stressed that reasonableness review and correctness review are \\nmethodologically distinct (para.  12). Reasonableness review starts from a posture of \\njudicial restraint and focusses  on “the decision the administrative decision maker \\nactually made, including the justification offered for it, and not on the conclusion the \\ncourt itself would have reached in the administrative decision maker’s place” (paras. 15 \\nand 24). When an administr ative decision maker is required to provide reasons for its \\ndecision, reasonableness review requires a “sensitive and respectful, but robust” \\nevaluation of the reasons provided (para. 12). A reviewing court must take a “reasons \\nfirst” approach that evaluat es the administrative decision maker’s justification for its \\ndecision (para. 84). An administrative decision will be reasonable if it “is based on an \\ninternally coherent and rational chain of analysis and .  . . is justified in relation to the \\nfacts and law that constrain the decision maker” (para.  85). This Court also affirmed \\n“the need to develop and strengthen a culture of justification in administrative decision \\nmaking” (para. 2). \\n[9] Applying the Vavilov framework to these appeals, I conclude that the \\nstandard of review of the administrative decisions at issue is reasonableness. No \\nestablished exception to the presumption of reasonableness review applies, nor should \\n \\nof general importance certified for appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal under s. 74(d) \\nof the IRPA. The certified question regime is a statutory mechanism for the Federal \\nCourt to provide for an appeal from a judicial review decision in certain circumstances. \\n[10] Both administrative decisions were unreasonable. In particular, the IAD in \\nMr. Mason’s case, whose interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) was followed in Mr. Dleiow’s \\ncase, failed to consider three significant legal constraints bearing on its decision. First, \\nthe IAD failed to address critical points of statutory context that Mr. Mason had raised \\nin his submissions to the IAD. Second, the IAD failed to address the potentially broad \\nconsequences of its interpretation, which again Mr. Mason had raised in his \\nsubmissions. These omissions involved significant failures of “responsive \\njustification” that would cause a reviewing court to lose confidence in the IAD’s \\ndecision. Third, the IAD failed to interpret and apply s.  34(1)(e) in compliance with \\ninternational human rights instruments to which Canada is a signatory — specifically, \\nthe obligation of non-refoulement under Article 33(1) of the 1951 Convention Relating \\nto the Status of Refugees, Can. T.S. 1969 No. 6 (“Refugee Convention”) — contrary to \\nthe express direction in s. 3(3)(f) of the IRPA that it must do so. The IAD’s failure to \\nconsider these three legal constraints rendered its decision unreasonable. \\n[11] In these cases, the relevant legal constraints point overwhelmingly to a \\nsingle reasonable interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) — a person can be found inadmissible \\nunder s. 34(1)(e) only if they engage in acts of violence with a nexus to national security \\n \\n[12] As a result, I would allow both appeals, set aside the judgments of the \\nFederal Court of Appe al, allow the applications for judicial review, and quash the \\nadministrative decisions. \\nII. Facts \\nA. Mr. Earl Mason \\n[13] Mr. Earl Mason is a citizen of Saint Lucia and a “foreign national” in \\nCanada — that is, he is neither a Canadian citizen nor a permanent resident \\n(IRPA, s. 2(1), “foreign national”). He is married to a Canadian citizen and has two \\ndaughters in Canada. He entered Canada in June 2010 and has remained here as a \\nforeign national. He claimed refugee protection when he arrived in Canada, but he later \\nwithdrew this claim when he applied for permanent residence with his wife’s \\nsponsorship. \\n[14] The following allegations were made against Mr.  Mason in the \\ninadmissibility proceedings under review. In May 2012, Mr.  Mason had an argument \\nwith a man at a concert in a bar in Surrey, British Columbia. The man broke a beer \\nbottle over Mr.  Mason’s head, and Mr.  Mason responded by drawing a gun from his \\nwaistband and firing it eight times, wounding his assailant and another man. In \\nMay 2014, Mr.  Mason was charged with two c ounts of attempted murder and two \\n \\nlinked to terrorism or organized crime. In 2015, the charges were stayed because of \\ndelay. As a result, Mr. Mason was not found guilty of any criminal offence. \\n[15] The IRPA sets out several grounds on which a permanent resident or \\nforeign national may be found inadmissible, and thus may be denied entry to or be \\nrequired to leave Canada (ss.  34 to 42). In April 2016, a Canada Border Services \\nAgency (“CBSA”) officer prepared a report alleging that Mr. Mason was inadmissible \\non “security grounds” under s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA, which provides that a permanent \\nresident or foreign national is inadmissible for “engaging in acts of violence that would \\nor might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada”. Section 34(1) states: \\nSecurity \\n \\n34 (1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible on \\nsecurity grounds for \\n \\n(a) engaging in an act of espionage that is against Canada or that is \\ncontrary to Canada’s interests; \\n \\n(b) engaging in or instigating the subversion by force of any \\ngovernment; \\n \\n(b.1) engaging in an act of subversion against a democratic government, \\ninstitution or process as they are understood in Canada; \\n \\n(c) engaging in terrorism; \\n \\n(d) being a danger to the security of Canada; \\n \\n(e) engaging in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives \\nor safety of persons in Canada; or \\n \\n(f) being a member of an organization that there are reasonable grounds \\nto believe engages, has engaged or will engage in acts referred to in \\n \\n[16] In May 2016, a delegate of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency \\nPreparedness referred the CBSA’s inadmissibility report to the ID for an admissibility \\nhearing. \\nB. Mr. Seifeslam Dleiow \\n[17] Mr. Seifeslam Dleiow is a citizen of Libya and a foreign national in \\nCanada. He entered Canada in June 2012 on a study permit, which expired in 2014. In \\n2015, he made a claim for refugee protection. In October 2017, the Refugee Protection \\nDivision of the IRB refused his claim, and in October 2018, the Refugee Appeal \\nDivision dismissed his appeal. \\n[18] In September 2018, a CBSA officer prepared a report alleg ing that \\nMr. Dleiow was inadmissible on security grounds under s. 34(1)(e). The report alleged \\nthat since arriving in Canada, Mr.  Dleiow had engaged in acts of violence against \\nintimate partners and other persons. Criminal charges flowing from these incide nts \\nwere stayed, except for 3 charges: being unlawfully in a dwelling house with intent to \\ncommit an indictable offence, mischief under $5,000, and uttering threats to cause \\ndeath or bodily harm. Mr.  Dleiow pleaded guilty to these charges and received a \\nconditional discharge. A delegate of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency \\nPreparedness then referred the CBSA’s inadmissibility report to the ID for an \\nadmissibility hearing. \\n \\nA. Immigration Division Decision (Mr. Mason), 2018 CanLII 57522 \\n[19] The ID addressed a preliminary question of law as to whether Mr. Mason’s \\nalleged conduct, if proven, could be a ground of inadmissibility under s. 34(1)(e). The \\nID ruled that a “security groun[d]” under s.  34(1) means a threat to the security of \\nCanada or another country, and that the act of violence in question must have some \\nconnection to a threat to the security of Canada. In the ID’s view, Mr. Mason’s alleged \\nconduct involved “mere criminal offences”, which “although very serious”, lacked \\n“any element that would elevate them to security grounds”, and thus s.  34(1)(e) could \\nnot apply (para. 24). \\nB. Immigration Appeal Division Decision (Mr. Mason), 2019 CanLII 55171 \\n[20] The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness appealed the \\nID’s decision in Mr. Mason’s case to the IAD, which allowed the Minister’s appeal, set \\naside the ID’s decision, and referred the matter back for a full hearing on the merits. \\nThe IAD concluded that inadmissibility under s.  34(1)(e) does not require a link to \\nnational security or  the security of Canada. In the IAD’s view, “security” under \\ns. 34(1)(e) relates to “security in a broader sense”, namely, to ensure “that individual \\nCanadians are secure from acts of violence that would or might endanger their lives or \\nsafety” (para. 37). \\n \\n[21] In Mr.  Dleiow’s case, the ID saw no basis to depart from the IAD’s \\ninterpretation of s. 34(1)(e) in Mr. Mason’s case, and therefore affirmed that s. 34(1)(e) \\ndoes not require a link to national security or the security of Canada. The ID also heard \\nevidence and concluded that Mr. Dleiow was inadmissible because he had engaged in \\nviolent acts against two intimate partners, which there were reasonable grounds to \\nbelieve had endangered their safety. The ID based this conclusion on a guilty plea for \\nacts relating to one intimate partner, and on testimony and police occurrence reports \\nrelating to the other intimate partner. As a result, the ID ruled that Mr.  Dleiow was \\ninadmissible and issued a deportation order. \\nD. Federal Court Decision (Mr. Mason), 2019 FC 1251, [2020] 2 F.C.R. 3 \\n(Grammond J.) \\n[22] The Federal Court granted Mr.  Mason’s application for judicial review of \\nthe IAD’s decision. The court held that the IAD’s interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) of the \\nIRPA was unreasonable because it disregarded the structure of the Act and rendered \\nmeaningless statutory provisions for inadmissibility based on criminality. In the \\nFederal Court’s view, s. 34(1)(e) requires a link to national security. \\n[23] The Federal Court — whose reasons were released before this Court \\nreleased Vavilov — outlined how a reviewing court should evaluate the reasonableness \\nof an administrative decision maker’s interpretation of a statute. In the Federal Court’s \\nview, a reviewing court must ensure  that an administrative decision maker did not \\n \\nis internally consistent, withstands scrutiny, and is not met by a countervailing \\ninterpretation of similar force — or cho ose an interpretation when the interpretive \\n“clues” point overwhelmingly in the other direction. \\n[24] The Federal Court ruled that the IAD’s interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) was \\nunreasonable because it conflicted with the broader structure of the IRPA, thus \\nundermining Parliament’s intent. In the court’s view, this structural argument was a \\n“knock-out punch”. The IAD’s decision upset the carefully crafted structure of the \\nIRPA by including under s.  34(1)(e) a vast range of conduct that “would or might \\nendanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada”. This would thwart Parliament’s \\nintent by bringing under the most serious category of inadmissibility conduct falling \\nbelow the thresholds for less serious categories of inadmissibility, and it would discard \\nParliament’s choice under s.  36 of the IRPA to require a conviction when criminal \\nconduct was committed in Canada. Section 36(1) and (2) of the IRPA provide for \\ninadmissibility based on “serious criminality” and “criminality” as follows: \\nSerious criminality \\n \\n36 (1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible on \\ngrounds of serious criminality for \\n \\n(a) having been convicted in Canada of an offence under an Act of \\nParliament punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least \\n10 years, or of an offence under an Act of Parliament for which a term \\nof imprisonment of more than six months has been imposed; \\n \\n(b) having been convicted of an offence outside Canada that, if \\ncommitted in Canada, would constitute an offence under an Act of \\nParliament punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least \\n \\n \\n(c) committing an act outside Canada that is an offence in the place \\nwhere it was committed and that, if committed in Canada, would \\nconstitute an offence under an Act of Parliament punishable by  a \\nmaximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years. \\n \\nCriminality \\n \\n(2) A foreign national is inadmissible on grounds of criminality for \\n \\n(a) having been convicted in Canada of an offence under an Act of \\nParliament punishable by way of indictment, or of tw o offences under \\nany Act of Parliament not arising out of a single occurrence; \\n \\n(b) having been convicted outside Canada of an offence that, if \\ncommitted in Canada, would constitute an indictable offence under an \\nAct of Parliament, or of two offences not a rising out of a single \\noccurrence that, if committed in Canada, would constitute offences \\nunder an Act of Parliament; \\n \\n(c) committing an act outside Canada that is an offence in the place \\nwhere it was committed and that, if committed in Canada, would \\nconstitute an indictable offence under an Act of Parliament; or \\n \\n(d) committing, on entering Canada, an offence under an Act of \\nParliament prescribed by regulations. \\n[25] The Federal Court found all the countervailing points of interpretive \\ncontext unpersuasive and ruled that only one reasonable interpretation was available. \\nIt therefore quashed the IAD’s decision and restored the ID’s decision. \\n[26] The Federal Court certified the following serious question of general \\nimportance for appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal:  Is it reasonable to interpret \\ns. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA in a manner that does not require proof of conduct that has a \\n \\nE. Federal Court Decision (Mr. Dleiow), 2020 FC 59 (Barnes J.) \\n[27] The Federal Court allowed Mr. Dleiow’s application for judicial review of \\nthe ID’s decision. The court applied the Federal Court’s reasoning in Mr. Mason’s case \\nfor reasons of comity, set aside the ID’s decision and ordered the matter be reconsidered \\non the merits by a diffe rent decision maker. The court also certified the same serious \\nquestion of general importance. \\nF. Federal Court of Appeal (Mr. Mason and Mr. Dleiow), 2021 FCA 156, [2022] 1 \\nF.C.R. 3 (Stratas J.A., Rennie and Mactavish JJ.A. concurring) \\n[28] The Federal Court of Ap peal decided the appeals in Mr. Mason’s and \\nMr. Dleiow’s cases together, after this Court had released Vavilov. The court held that \\nthe administrative decisions reasonably interpreted s. 34(1)(e) as not requiring a nexus \\nwith national security or the security of Canada. \\n[29] The Court of Appeal began by discussing how a court should conduct \\nreasonableness review. The court said that “ Vavilov tells us much but it leaves some \\nthings unclear” (para. 9). The court cautioned that a reviewing court should not fashion \\nits own yardstick and use it to measure what the administrator did, but should instead \\nconduct “a preliminary analysis of the text, context and purpose of the legislation just \\nto understand the lay of the land before they examine the administrators’ reason s” \\n(para. 17). The Court of Appeal also criticized the Federal Court’s “knock-out punch” \\n \\n[30] The Court of Appeal concluded that the IAD was alive to the essential \\nelements of s.  34(1)(e)’s text, context, and purpose, and saw no omitted aspects that \\nwould cause a loss of confidence in the outcome. It rejected Mr. Mason’s argument that \\nreading s. 34(1)(e) without a nexus to national security is inconsistent with the broader \\nstatutory context. The court ruled that the IAD reasonably concluded that the conduct \\ncaptured by s.  34(1)(e), which speaks of the danger posed to the “lives or safety” of \\npersons in Canada, is only a small subset of what would be considered serious \\ncriminality under s. 36 of the IRPA. Sections 34 and 36 address two different matters \\n— conduct and convictions, respectively (para.  55). Section 36 is much broader, and \\napplies to much non -violent criminal behaviour; s.  34(1)(e) is narrower, and applies \\nonly to acts of violence. The court noted that when the IAD said that s. 34(1)(e) is not \\nabsurdly broad because the conduct captured by the provision is “narrowly defined”, \\nthis could only mean that it interpreted “safety” in s.  34(1)(e) as “something \\napproaching the level of a th reat to life, not just minor harm” (para.  57). The court \\nstated that although the IAD did not address certain contextual arguments, this failure \\nwas not a fundamental gap and did not cause the court to lose confidence in its outcome \\nso as to make its decision unreasonable. \\n[31] In contending that s. 34(1)(e) requires a nexus with national security or the \\nsecurity of Canada, Mr.  Mason also invoked the Refugee Convention  and the 1967 \\nProtocol Relating to the Status of Refugees , Can.  T.S. 1969 No.  29 (“ Refugee \\nProtocol”). The Court of Appeal declined to entertain this argument because it viewed \\n \\nbackground documents and other instruments needed to understand any international \\nobligations” were not in evidence (para. 74). \\n[32] The Court of Appeal concluded that some elements of s.  34(1)(e)’s text, \\ncontext, and purpose favoured the need for a nexus with national security or the security \\nof Canada, while others did not. It stated that “the i ssue of legislative interpretation is \\nbest described as one where the issue is open to some debate” (para. 76). \\n[33] In the result, the Court of Appeal ruled that it is reasonable to interpret \\ns. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA in a manner that does not require proof of conduct with a nexus \\nto “national security” or “the security of Canada”. The court therefore allowed the \\nappeals, set aside the judgments of the Federal Court, and dismissed the applications \\nfor judicial review. \\nIV. Issues \\n[34] These appeals raise two issues: (1) Wh at is the appropriate standard of \\nreview of the administrative decisions at issue? (2) Was that standard of review applied \\nproperly in these cases? \\nV. Analysis \\n[35] In what follows, I first address the applicable standard of review and \\n \\nreasonableness review and apply that guidance to these cases. I conclude that the \\nadministrative decision makers’ reasons involved failures of justification that made \\ntheir decisions unreasonable. \\nA. The Standard of Review \\n[36] The first issue concerns the appropriate standard of review. As this Court \\nhas noted, “[a] reviewing judge’s selection and application of the standard of review is \\nreviewable for correctness” ( Northern Regional Health Authority v. Horrocks , 2021 \\nSCC 42, at para.  10, citing Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency \\nPreparedness), 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 559, at paras. 45-47). An appellate court \\nmust “ste[p] into the shoes” of the lower court and focus on the administrative decision \\nunder review ( Agraira, at para.  46, citing Merck Frosst Canada Ltd. v. Canada \\n(Health), 2012 SCC 3, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 23, at para. 247, per Deschamps J., dissenting). \\nOn this approach, an appellate court “accords no deference to the reviewing judge’s \\napplication of the standard of review”, but rather “performs a de novo review of the \\nadministrative decision” ( Horrocks, at para.  10, citing D.  J. M. Brown, wit h the \\nassistance of D. Fairlie, Civil Appeals (loose-leaf), at § 14:45). None of these principles \\nwas changed by this Court’s decision in Vavilov. As a result, the issue is whether the \\nFederal Court selected the correct standard of review and applied it properly (Agraira, \\nat para. 47). \\n[37] Before this Court, the appellant Mr. Mason and the intervener the Canadian \\n \\npre-Vavilov jurisprudence, they say that because the appeal  to the Federal Court of \\nAppeal involved a “serious question of general importance” certified under s. 74(d) of \\nthe IRPA, it would be “incoherent” if the standard were not correctness (A.F., at \\npara. 49, citing Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizensh ip and Immigration) , \\n[1998] 1 S.C.R. 982, at para. 43). The certified question regime under s. 74(d) of the \\nIRPA provides a mechanism for the Federal Court to provide for a statutory appeal of \\na judicial review decision that raises a serious question that is dispositive of the appeal, \\ntranscends the interests of the parties, and raises an issue of broad significance or \\ngeneral importance ( Lunyamila v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency \\nPreparedness), 2018 FCA 22, [2018] 3 F.C.R. 674, at para.  46; Canada (Immigration \\nand Citizenship) v. Laing , 2021 FCA 194, at para.  11 (CanLII); see also Canada \\n(Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v. XY, 2022 FCA 113, 89 Imm. L.R. (4th) \\n173, at para. 7). The appellant Mr. Mason and the intervener the Canadian Association \\nof Refugee Lawyers say that the certified question regime “weighs in favour of a \\ncorrectness standard” and “evinces a particular concern that questions of general \\nimportance be appropriately resolved” (A.F., at para.  49, citing Chieu v. Canada \\n(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 SCC 3, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 84, at para. 23; \\nsee also I.F., at paras. 4-10). \\n[38] I respectfully disagree with this submission. In my view, the standard of \\nreview of the administrative decisions is reasonableness. This conclusion rests on three \\npropositions: (1) Vavilov established that the standard of review of the merits of an \\n \\nto the presumption of review for reasonableness applies in these c ases; and (3) the \\ncertified question regime under s. 74(d) of the IRPA does not displace the presumption \\nof reasonableness review and warrant recognition of a new category of correctness. I \\nwill address each point in turn. \\n(1) The Standard of Review Is Presumptively Reasonableness \\n[39] In Vavilov, this Court established a presumption that when a court reviews \\nthe merits of an administrative decision, the standard of review is reasonableness \\n(para. 16; Canada Post Corp. v. Canadian Union of Postal Workers , 2019 SCC 6 7, \\n[2019] 4 S.C.R. 900, at para.  27). This presumption is rebutted in two types of \\nsituations, which together provide six categories of correctness review  (Vavilov, at \\nparas. 17 and 69; Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada v. \\nEntertainment Software Association , 2022 SCC 30, at para.  40). The first type of \\nsituation is where the legislature has indicated that it intends a different standard or set \\nof standards to apply, and the second type of situation is where the rule of law requires \\nthat the standard of correctness be applied ( Vavilov, at para. 17). Vavilov thus sets out \\na “general rule” of reasonableness review, “subject to limited exceptions” (D. Mullan, \\n“Reasonableness Review Post-Vavilov: An ‘Encomium for Correctness’ or Deferen ce \\nAs Usual?” (2021), 23 C.L.E.L.J. 189, at p. 200). \\n[40] The first situation, based on legislative intent, provides for two categories \\nof correctness review: when the legislature explicitly prescribes the standard of review, \\n \\nsignalling that appellate standards of review apply (Vavilov, at para. 17; Canada Post, \\nat para. 27).  \\n[41] As for the second situation, Vavilov set out three categories of questions \\nthat the rule of law requires to be reviewed on a standard of correctness: constitutional \\nquestions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole, \\nand questions related to the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more \\nadministrative bodies (para. 17; Canada Post, at para. 27).  \\n[42] At the time it was rendered, Vavilov thus recognized five categories of \\ncorrectness review: (1) legislated standards of review; (2) statutory appeal mechanisms; \\n(3) constitutional questions; (4) general questions of law of ce ntral importance to the \\nlegal system as a whole; and (5) questions related to the jurisdictional boundaries \\nbetween two or more administrative bodies (paras. 17 and 69). \\n[43] At the same time, Vavilov did not definitively foreclose the possibility of \\nrecognizing new categories of correctness “[i]n rare and exceptional circumstances . . . \\nwhen applying reasonableness would undermine legislative intent or the rule of law in \\na manner analogous to the five correctness categories” already identified ( Society of \\nComposers, at para.  27; Vavilov, at para.  70). This Court recently recognized a sixth \\ncategory of correctness review in Society of Composers , a case involving copyright \\nroyalties for works accessed online: (6) “when courts and administrative bodies have \\nconcurrent first instance jurisdiction over a legal issue in a statute” (para.  28). The \\n \\njurisdiction regarding the interpretation of the Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C -42, \\nwhich signals “a legislative intent for judicial involvement” (para.  31) and highlights \\nthe need for consistent and definitive interpretation of the Copyright Act to maintain \\nthe rule of law (paras. 33-35). \\n[44] The presumption of reasonableness review and the l imited circumstances \\nin which it is rebutted provide a comprehensive framework for determining the \\nstandard of review. This framework brings simplicity, coherence, and predictability to \\nthe law on the standard of review, since reviewing courts need no long er conduct an \\nunwieldy “contextual” inquiry to identify the appropriate standard of review, as had \\nbeen the case in the period before Vavilov (Vavilov, at paras. 7 and 17). \\n(2) No Established Exception to the Presumption Applies  \\n[45] None of the established except ions to the presumption of reasonableness \\nreview applies in these cases. \\n[46] First, the legislature has not explicitly prescribed the standard of review or \\nprovided a statutory appeal mechanism from an administrative decision to a court. The \\npresent cases proceeded to the Federal Court on applications for judicial review under \\ns. 72(1) of the IRPA, which does not prescribe the standard of review.  \\n[47] Second, the standard of correctness is not required based on the rule of law. \\n \\ncentral importance to the legal system as a whole” under Vavilov (paras. 58-62). Such \\n“general questions of law” require uniform and consistent answers because of their \\nimpact on the administration of ju stice as a whole or for other institutions of \\ngovernment (para. 59). Examples of general questions of law include questions with \\nlegal implications for many other statutes or for the proper functioning of the justice \\nsystem as a whole (paras.  59-61). It is  not enough for the question to “touc[h] on an \\nimportant issue” or to raise an issue of “wider public concern” (para. 61). Although the \\nproper interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) is important for the affected persons and the proper \\nadministration of the IRPA, it does not affect the legal system or the administration of \\njustice as a whole, have legal implications for many other statutes, or affect other \\ninstitutions of government. Rather, the issues raised are particular to the interpretation \\nof the conditions for  inadmissibility under s.  34(1)(e). Moreover, the proper \\ninterpretation of s. 34(1)(e) is not a constitutional question or a question related to the \\njurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies, nor does it \\nengage the correctness category recognized in Society of Composers. Thus, the rule of \\nlaw does not require the Federal Court to review an administrative interpretation of \\ns. 34(1)(e) for correctness. \\n(3) The Certified Question Regime Under the IRPA Does Not Displace the \\nPresumption  \\n[48] Nor does the certified question regime under s. 74(d) of the IRPA displace \\nthe presumption of reasonableness review and warrant a new category of correctness. \\n \\nCourt of Appeal provides for a statutory appeal of the Federal Court’ s decision to the \\nFederal Court of Appeal, but it does not change the standard of review to be applied by \\neither court.  \\n[49] To begin with, it is obvious that the Federal Court’s decision to certify a \\nserious question of general importance under s. 74(d) does not affect the standard of \\nreview to be applied by the Federal Court itself  on the application for judicial review \\nunder s. 72(1) of the IRPA. The Federal Court does not certify the question until it is \\nrendering its judgment on the application for judicia l review. Section 74(d) provides \\nthat an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal may be made “only if, in rendering \\njudgment, the [Federal Court] certifies that a serious question of general importance is \\ninvolved and states the question”. In effect, the cer tified question procedure plays a \\ngatekeeping role by requiring the matter to meet a threshold of importance to merit an \\nappeal to the Federal Court of Appeal. As this Court has stated, the certified question \\n“may be the ‘trigger’ by which an appeal is per mitted”, but the “subject of the appeal \\nis still the judgment itself, not merely the certified question” ( Kanthasamy v. Canada \\n(Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 61, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 909, at para.  44, citing \\nBaker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  Immigration), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, at \\npara. 12). Thus, the certified question regime does not amount to “rare and exceptional \\ncircumstances” in which the Federal Court applying reasonableness review would \\nundermine legislative intent or the rule of law in  a manner analogous to the existing \\n \\n[50] The issue is then whether the certification of a serious question of general \\nimportance requires correctness review by the Federal Court of Appeal or th is Court, \\neither because of a legislative intent to apply correctness review or because it is required \\nby the rule of law. In my view, the answer is no. \\n[51] As a matter of precedent, this Court has concluded in the immigration \\ncontext that “[d]espite the prese nce of a certified question, the .  . . standard of review \\nis reasonableness” (Kanthasamy, at para. 44; see also Baker, at para. 62). Vavilov does \\nnot require that conclusion to be revisited. Certification of a question under s. 74(d) of \\nthe IRPA does not s ignal that the legislature intended that appellate courts apply \\ncorrectness review. As noted above, the Federal Court of Appeal’s task in an appeal \\nfrom a decision of the Federal Court in an application for judicial review — including \\nin an appeal based on a certified question — is to determine whether the Federal Court \\nidentified the appropriate standard of review, and then to decide whether it applied that \\nstandard properly (Agraira, at paras. 45-47; Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. \\nGalindo Camayo, 2022 FCA 50, 468 D.L.R. (4th) 358, at para. 38, citing Horrocks, at \\npara. 10). The Federal Court of Appeal must “step into the shoes” of the Federal Court \\nand apply the same standard of review that it should have applied ( Galindo Camayo, \\nat para. 38, citing Kanthasamy, at para. 44). Here, the Federal Court had to judicially \\nreview the administrative decisions for reasonableness. The Federal Court of Appeal, \\nwhen stepping into the shoes of the Federal Court on the certified question, had to do \\n \\nreasonableness, nor alters the Court of Appeal’s task when it hears appeals from first \\ninstance judicial review decisions.    \\n[52] What is more, recall that Vavilov itself involved an app eal to the Federal \\nCourt of Appeal on a certified question of general importance under s. 22.2(d) of the \\nCitizenship Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29, which provides — in terms materially identical \\nto s. 74(d) of the IRPA — that “an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal may be made \\nonly if, in rendering judgment, the judge certifies that a serious question of general \\nimportance is involved and states the question”. This Court in Vavilov reviewed the \\nadministrative decision at issue for reasonableness, noting that there was “no indication \\nthat the legislature intended a standard of review other than reasonableness to apply” \\n(para. 170). \\n[53] Finally, recognizing a new correctness category here would conflict with \\nVavilov’s goal of simplifying and making more predictable the standard of review \\nframework by providing only limited exceptions to reasonableness review (para.  47). \\nTreating s.  74(d) as justifying correctness review would effectively reintroduce a \\n“contextual” approach to the standard of review — with the certification of a serious \\nquestion of general importance being a “contextual” factor suggesting correctness — \\nand thus would revive the approach that Vavilov eliminated because it created \\n“uncertainty” and was “unwieldy” (para. 7; see also P. Daly, “Unresolved Issues after \\n \\nsimplification and clarification” that “excised” the “‘vexing contextual factors’ .  . . \\nfrom the standard of review selection exercise”.)). \\n(4) Conclusion \\n[54] I conclude that no exception to the presumption of reasonableness applies \\nin these cases. As a result, the standard of review of the decisions of the IAD in \\nMr. Mason’s case and the ID in Mr. Dleiow’s case is reasonableness. \\nB. Reasonableness Review \\n[55] I now turn to the second issue in these appeals: whether the administrative \\ndecisions under review were reasonable. This section recaps Vavilov’s guidance on \\nconducting reasonableness review and comments briefly on the methodology of \\nreasonableness review conducted by the courts  below. The following section then \\napplies reasonableness review to the two administrative decisions at issue. \\n(1) Vavilov’s Guidance on Reasonableness Review of Administrative \\nDecisions \\n[56] Vavilov provided extensive guidance on conducting reasonableness review \\nof administrative decisions (paras. 73 -142). Without canvassing every detail of that \\n \\n(a) The Purpose of Reasonableness Review: Upholding the Rule of Law While \\nAccording Deference \\n[57] Vavilov explained that the purpose of reasonableness review is “to give \\neffect to the legislature’s intent to leave certain decisions with an administrative body \\nwhile fulfilling the constitutional role of judicial review to ensure that exercises of state \\npower are subject to the rule of law” (para.  82). Reasonableness review starts from a \\nposture of judicial restraint and “a respect for the distinct role of administrative decision \\nmakers” (para. 13), arising from the legislature’s institutional design choice to give \\nadministrative decision makers rather than courts the jurisdiction to decide certain \\nissues (para.  24). Reasonableness review also serves to “maintain the rule of law” \\n(para. 2) and “to safeguard the legality, rationality and fairness of the administrative \\nprocess” (para. 13). Thus, the purpose of reasonableness review is to uphold “the rule \\nof law, while according deference to the statutory delegate’s decision” ( Canada Post, \\nat para. 29). \\n(b) A “Reasons First” Approach \\n[58] Vavilov noted that, given the deference owed to an administrative decision, \\nreasonableness review is “methodologically distinct” from correctness review \\n(para. 12). The Court explained that “[w]hat distinguishes reasonableness review from \\ncorrectness review is that the court conducting a reasonableness review must focus on \\nthe decision the administrative decision maker actually made, including the \\n \\nin the administrative decision maker’s place” (para. 15). Reasonableness review is thus \\nconcerned with both the administrator’s decision -making process and the outcome \\n(paras. 83 and 87; see also Canada Post, at para. 29). \\n[59] When an adminis trative decision maker is required by the legislative \\nscheme or the duty of procedural fairness to provide reasons for its decision, the reasons \\n“are the primary mechanism by which administrative decision makers show that their \\ndecisions are reasonable” ( Vavilov, at para.  81).1 The purpose of reasons is to \\n“demonstrate ‘justification, transparency and intelligibility’” (para.  81). Reasons are \\n“the means by which the decision maker communicates the rationale for its decision” \\n(para. 84). This Court emphasized that “it is not enough for the outcome of a decision \\nto be justifiable. Where reasons for a decision are required, the decision must also be \\njustified, by way of those reasons, by the decision maker to those to whom the decision \\napplies” (para. 86 (emphasis in original)). \\n[60] A decision will be unreasonable when the reasons “fail to provide a \\ntransparent and intelligible justification” for the result (para.  136). A reviewing court \\nmust therefore take a “reasons first” approach that evaluates the administrative decision \\nmaker’s justification for its decision (para.  84). It must “begin its inquiry into the \\nreasonableness of a decision by examining the reasons provided with ‘respectful \\nattention’ and seeking to understand the reasoning process followed by the dec ision \\n                                                 \\n1 When formal reasons are not required, a reviewing court will evaluate the administrative decision \\nmaker’s reasoning process by looking at the context and the record as a whole in order to unde rstand \\nthe decision (Vavilov, at paras. 136-38). In such a case, the reviewing court’s analysis will “focus on \\n \\nmaker to arrive at its conclusion” (para.  84, citing D. Dyzenhaus, “The Politics of \\nDeference: Judicial Review and Democracy”, in M. Taggart, ed., The Province of \\nAdministrative Law (1997), 279, at p. 286). As noted by Professor David Mullan, the \\n“reasons first” approach “underscores a commitment to deference” and requires that \\nreasons are “the principal lens through which the exercise of reasonableness review \\ntakes place” (p.  202). Thus, as he explains, “the starting or focal point for the \\nconducting of truly deferential reasonableness review should be the reasons provided \\nby the decision-maker” (p. 215; see also Daly (2022), at pp. 108-10). \\n[61] Under Vavilov’s “reasons first” approach, the reviewing court should \\nremember that “the written reasons given b y an administrative body must not be \\nassessed against a standard of perfection”, and need not “include all the arguments, \\nstatutory provisions, jurisprudence or other details the reviewing judge would have \\npreferred” (para.  91). The reviewing judge must re ad the administrator’s reasons \\n“holistically and contextually” (para.  97), “in light of the history and context of the \\nproceedings in which they were rendered”, including “the evidence before the decision \\nmaker, the submissions of the parties, publicly ava ilable policies or guidelines that \\ninformed the decision maker’s work, and past decisions of the relevant administrative \\nbody” (para. 94). Reasons must be read “in light of the record and with due sensitivity \\nto the administrative regime in which they were  given” (para. 103). Such factors may \\n“explain an aspect of the decision maker’s reasoning process that is not apparent from \\nthe reasons themselves, or may reveal that an apparent shortcoming in the reasons is \\n \\n[62] A reviewing court should also avoid engaging in “disguised correctness \\nreview”, or correctness in the guise of reasonableness (para.  294, per Abella and \\nKarakatsanis JJ., concurring in the result; see also Wilson v. Atomic Energy of Canada \\nLtd., 2016 SCC 29, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 770, at para.  27, citing D.  Mullan, “Unresolved \\nIssues on Standard of Review in Canadian Judicial Review of Administrative Action \\n— The Top Fifteen!” (2013), 42 Adv. Q. 1, at pp. 76-81). Because “[t]he role of courts \\nin these circumstances is to review”, they should, as a general rule, “refrain from \\ndeciding the issue themselves” ( Vavilov, at para.  83 (emphasis in original)). A \\nreviewing court should not create its “own yardstick and then use [it] to measure what \\nthe administrator did” (para.  83, and Canada Post, at para.  40, both citing Delios v. \\nCanada (Attorney General), 2015 FCA 117, 100 Admin.  L.R. (5th) 301, at para.  28). \\nNor should a reviewing court ask “what decision it would h ave made in place of that \\nof the administrative decision maker, attempt to ascertain the ‘range’ of possible \\nconclusions that would have been open to the decision maker, conduct a de novo  \\nanalysis or seek to determine the ‘correct’ solution to the problem”  (Vavilov, at \\npara. 83; see also Canada Post, at para. 40). Rather, a “reviewing court must consider \\nonly whether the decision made by the administrative decision maker — including both \\nthe rationale for the decision and the outcome to which it led — was unreasonable” \\n(Vavilov, at para. 83). \\n[63] Finally, Vavilov cautioned that the “reasons first” approach is “not a \\n‘rubber-stamping’ process or a means of sheltering administrative decision makers \\n \\nalso paras. 12, 67 and 138), one that highlights “the need to develop and strengthen a \\nculture of justification in administrative decision making” (para. 2). \\n(c) Indicators of Unreasonableness \\n[64] Vavilov identified two types of “fundamental  flaws” indicating that an \\nadministrative decision is unreasonable: (1) a failure of rationality internal to the \\nreasoning process; or (2) a failure of justification given the legal and factual constraints \\nbearing on the decision (para.  101). A reviewing c ourt need not categorize \\nunreasonableness as falling into one category or another. They are simply a helpful way \\nof describing how a decision may be unreasonable (para. 101). \\n(i) Failures of Rationality in the Reasoning Process \\n[65] A failure of rationality in the reasoning process arises if the decision is not \\nrational or logical (paras.  102-4). A decision is unreasonable if, “read holistically”, it \\n“fail[s] to reveal a rational chain of analysis” or “reveal[s] that the decision was based \\non an irrational chain of analysis” (para. 103). A reviewing court “must be able to trace \\nthe decision maker’s reasoning without encountering any fatal flaws” in the decision \\nmaker’s “overarching logic” (para. 102). It must “be satisfied that the decision maker’s \\nreasoning ‘adds up’” (para. 104). \\n \\n[66] A failure of justification in light of the legal and factual constraints bearing \\non the decision arises if the decision is not “justified in relation to the constellati on of \\nlaw and facts that are relevant to the decision” (para. 105). The legal and factual context \\n“operate as constraints on the decision maker in the exercise of its delegated powers” \\n(para. 105). The burden of justification varies with the circumstances,  including the \\nwording of the relevant statutory provisions, the applicable precedents, the evidence, \\nthe submissions of the parties, and the impact of the decision on the affected persons. \\nThe greater the interpretive constraints in a given case, the grea ter the burden of \\njustification on the decision maker in deviating from those constraints (see M. Popescu, \\n“L’arrêt Vavilov: à la recherche de l’équilibre perdu entre la primauté du droit et la \\nsuprématie législative” (2021), 62 C. de D. 567, at p. 603). Examples include the seven \\nnon-exhaustive constraints set out below. As was highlighted in Vavilov, “[t]hese \\nelements are not a checklist for conducting reasonableness review, and they may vary \\nin significance depending on the context. They are offered mere ly to highlight some \\nelements of the surrounding context that can cause a reviewing court to lose confidence \\nin the outcome reached” (para. 106). \\n1. The Governing Statutory Scheme \\n[67] Whether an interpretation of the governing statutory scheme is justified \\nwill “ depend on the context, including the language chosen by the legislature in \\ndescribing the limits and contours of the decision maker’s authority” (para.  110). \\n \\nmaker, while “broa d, open -ended or highly qualitative language” affords greater \\nflexibility (para.  110). What matters is whether the decision maker has “properly \\njustified its interpretation of the statute in light of the surrounding context” (para. 110). \\n2. The Principles of Statutory Interpretation \\n[68] As already noted, a court evaluating the reasonableness of an \\nadministrative decision on a question of statutory interpretation “does not undertake a \\nde novo analysis of the question or ‘ask itself what the correct decision would h ave \\nbeen’” (para. 116). Instead, the court “must examine the administrative decision as a \\nwhole, including the reasons provided by the decision maker and the outcome that was \\nreached” (para. 116). \\n[69] Although an administrative decision maker need not “engage in a \\nformalistic statutory interpretation exercise in every case” (para. 119), its decision must \\nbe consistent with the “modern principle” of statutory interpretation, which focusses \\non the text, context, and purpose of the statutory provision. The decisio n maker must \\ndemonstrate in its reasons that it was alive to those essential elements (para. 120). The \\nomission of a minor aspect of the text, context, or purpose is unlikely to undermine the \\ndecision as a whole: omissions are not “stand -alone grounds for judicial intervention” \\n(para. 122). In each case, “the key question is whether the omitted aspect of the analysis \\ncauses the reviewing court to lose confidence in the outcome reached by the decision \\nmaker” (para.  122). For example, an administrative interp retation may well be \\n \\ninterpretation of a statutory provision for a large class of individuals, and whether, in \\nlight of those consequences, the legislature would have intended the provision to apply \\nin that way (paras. 191 -92). And even if a decision does not explicitly consider the \\nmeaning of a relevant provision, the court may be able to discern the interpretation \\nadopted from the record and evaluate whether it is reasonable (para. 123). \\n[70] In interpreting a statute, an administrative decision maker may draw on its \\ninstitutional expertise and experience and rely on considerations that a court would not \\nhave thought to employ, but which “enrich and elevate the interpretive exercise”  \\n(paras. 93 and 119; Canada Post, at para. 43). As Professor Audrey Macklin explains, \\ncourts should be “genuinely receptive to input beyond the usual techniques that courts \\nuse to discern text, context and purpose. These may include operational implication s, \\nalignment with broader statutory mandate, and so on” (“Seven Out of Nine Legal \\nExperts Agree: Expertise No Longer Matters (in the Same Way) After Vavilov!” \\n(2021), 100 S.C.L.R. (2d) 249, at p.  261). By being receptive to such factors, courts \\nacknowledge that administrative decision makers have a role to play in elaborating the \\ncontent of the schemes that they administer ( Vavilov, at para.  108). Reasonableness \\nreview demands both that administrative decision makers demonstrate their expertise \\nthrough their reasons and that judges pay “[r]espectful attention” to the ways in which \\ntheir reasons reflect that expertise (para.  93; P.  Daly, “ Vavilov and the Culture of \\nJustification in Contemporary Administrative Law” (2021), 100 S.C.L.R. (2d) 279, at \\n \\n[71] Finally, a court may conclude during a reasonableness review that “the \\ninterplay of text, context and purpose leaves room for a single reasonable interpretation \\nof the statutory provision, or aspect of the statutory provision” ( Vavilov, at para. 124, \\nciting Dunsmuir, at paras. 72-76, and Nova Tube Inc./Nova Steel Inc. v. Conares Metal \\nSupply Ltd., 2019 FCA 52). In such a case, although a court should “generally pause \\nbefore definitively pronouncing upon the interpretation” of a statutory provision, the \\ncourt may conclude that remitting the question to the administrative decision maker \\nmay serve no useful purpose ( Vavilov, at para.  124). It must be stressed that the \\npossibility of a single reasonable interpretation is not a starting point of reasonableness \\nreview, as this would be contrary to a “reasons first” approach. Rather, it is a conclusion \\nthat a reviewing court may draw as a result of a proper reasonableness review, as part \\nof the court’s consideration of the appropriate remedy.  \\n3. Relevant Statutory Law, Common Law, and International Law \\n[72] Statutory law, common law, and international law may operate as legal \\nconstraints on an administrative decision maker (paras.  111 and 114). An \\nadministrative decision will be unreasonable if it fails to justify a depar ture from \\nbinding precedents (para.  112). International law can also operate as an important \\nconstraint, arising from the presumption that legislation is presumed to operate in \\nconformity with Canada’s international obligations and the values and principle s of \\ncustomary and conventional international law, or by informing whether a decision was \\n \\n4. The Evidence and Facts Before the Decision Maker \\n[73] Absent exceptional circumstances, a reviewing court will defer to an \\nadministrative decision maker’s factual findings (para.  125). A reviewing court may \\nintervene, however, if the decision is unreasonable: if it is not “justified in light of the \\nfacts” or when “the decision maker has fundamentally misappreh ended or failed to \\naccount for the evidence before it” (para. 126). \\n5. The Submissions of the Parties \\n[74] An administrative decision maker’s reasons must “meaningfully account \\nfor the central issues and concerns raised by the parties” (para.  127). Reasons must be \\n“responsive” to the parties’ submissions, because reasons are the “primary mechanism \\nby which decision makers demonstrate that they have actually listened to the parties” \\n(para. 127 (emphasis in original)). Although an administrative decision does not hav e \\nto “respond to every argument or line of possible analysis” raised by the parties, “a \\ndecision maker’s failure to meaningfully grapple with key issues or central arguments \\nraised by the parties may call into question whether the decision maker was actual ly \\nalert and sensitive to the matter before it” (para. 128). \\n6. The Past Practices and Decisions of the Administrative Body \\n[75] Administrative decision makers should be concerned with the general \\n \\nsame way that courts are bound by stare decisis  (para. 129). A decision will be \\nunreasonable if the reasons fail to meet the “justificatory burden” for departing from \\n“longstanding practices or established internal authority” (para. 131). \\n7. The Potential Impact of the Decision on the Affected Individual \\n[76] Vavilov also explained that “[w]here the impact of a decision on an \\nindividual’s rights and interests is severe, the reasons provided to that individual must \\nreflect the stakes” (para. 133). The principle of “responsive justification” means that if \\na decision has “particularly harsh consequences for the affected individual”, then “the \\ndecision maker must explain why its decision best reflects the legislature’s intention” \\n(para. 133). An administrative decision may be unreasonable if it fails to grapple with \\nparticularly severe or harsh consequences for the affected individual (para.  134). An \\nadministrative decision maker’s reasons must “demonstrate that they have considered \\nthe consequences of a decision and that those consequences are justified in light of the \\nfacts and law” (para. 135). \\n[77] Having set out Vavilov’s guidance on conducting reasonableness review, I \\nnow comment briefly on the approach to reasonableness review of the courts below.   \\n(2) Methodology of Reasonableness Review in the Courts Below \\n[78] The Federal Court in Mr. Mason’s case did not have the benefit of Vavilov, \\n \\nthe administrative decisions. The  Federal Court essentially conducted its own \\nfreestanding interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) based on the provision’s text, context, and \\npurpose (paras.  38-51), and then evaluated the administrative decisions against that \\ninterpretation (paras. 52-62). As the C ourt of Appeal noted, this involved the Federal \\nCourt “fashioning its own yardstick to measure the administrator’s interpretation and \\ninterfering if the difference is too much” (para.  24). This approach was eschewed in \\nthis Court’s decision in Vavilov. \\n[79] But the Federal Court of Appeal also strayed from Vavilov’s methodology \\nof reasonableness review. The Court of Appeal grafted onto Vavilov an extra step of \\n“conducting a preliminary analysis of the text, context and purpose of the legislation \\njust to understa nd the lay of the land before .  . . examin[ing] the administrators’ \\nreasons” (para. 17). The parties before this Court contended that this preliminary step \\nis inconsistent with Vavilov. The respondent Minister of Citizenship and Immigration \\n— who otherwise agreed with the Court of Appeal’s conclusion — submitted that the \\nCourt of Appeal’s approach “should not be adopted”, and urged that “[t]he focus in the \\nreasonableness analysis needs to remain, as this Court has instructed, on the reasons of \\nthe decision-maker, and not on a range of potential conclusions to be determined by a \\nreviewing court in the abstract” (R.F., at para.  54). I agree. Vavilov is clear that a \\nreviewing court must start its analysis with the reasons of the administrative decision \\nmaker; s tarting with its own perception of the merits may lead a court to slip into \\n \\nC. Were the Administrative Decisions Reasonable? \\n[80] I now turn to consider whether the administrative decisions under review \\nreasonably interpreted s.  34(1)(e) of the  IRPA as not requiring a nexus with national \\nsecurity or the security of Canada. \\n[81] In reviewing the IAD’s reasons, I recall this Court’s instruction in Vavilov \\nthat a reviewing court should conduct reasonableness review mindful of the impact of \\nthe decision on the affected individual. The principle of “responsive justification” \\nmeans that “[w]here the impact of a decision on an individual’s rights and interests is \\nsevere, the reasons provided to that individual must reflect the stakes” (para.  133). \\nHere, the interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) will affect whether two individuals — one of \\nwhom has not been convicted of a criminal offence — could be deported from Canada. \\nAs this Court has noted, individuals facing deportation may experience “any number \\nof serious life-changing consequences”, including dislocation or permanent separation \\nfrom their family ( R. v. Wong , 2018 SCC 25, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 696, at para.  72, per \\nWagner J. (as he then was), dissenting). The IAD’s reasons must reflect these stakes. \\n[82] I begin by summarizing in greater detail the interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) in \\nthe reasons of the IAD in Mr. Mason’s case, which were followed by the ID in \\nMr. Dleiow’s case, before addressing what the appellants say are failures of \\njustification in the IAD’s reasons. \\n \\n[83] The IAD in Mr. Mason’s case ruled that a person can be inadmissible under \\ns. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA even without violent conduct linked to national security or the \\nsecurity of Canada. It decided the appeal based on the parties’ written submissions, and \\nconcluded that Parliament intended s. 34(1)(e) to “relate to security in a broader sense”, \\nincluding by ensuring that “individual Canadians are secure from acts of violence that \\nwould or might endanger their lives or safety” (para. 37). The IAD’s chain of reasoning \\nwas as follows: \\n\\uf0b7 Section 34(1)(e) cannot be read in isolation. The provision must be \\ninterpreted using the modern approach to statutory interpretation. The \\nwords used in s.  34(1)(e) must be assessed “in their entire con text and in \\ntheir grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the \\nAct, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament” (para. 17, citing \\nRizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21). \\n\\uf0b7 The other paragraphs of s. 34(1) all have a nexus to national security, which \\nmay be a signal of Parliament’s intent, but is not determinative. Context \\ncomes not just from “the immediate co -text, but from the overall scheme \\nand object of the IRPA” (para. 21). The inadmissibility provisions in Part 1, \\nDivision 4 of the IRPA are “particularly relevant” (para. 21). \\n\\uf0b7 In at least one prior decision, X (Re) , 2017 CanLII 146735 (I.R.B. \\n(Imm. Div.)), in which a foreign national allegedly assaulted his former \\n \\nID interpreted the terms “security” and “security grounds” in s. 34(1)(e) as \\nmeaning “the security of Canada” or “national security”. But this \\ninterpretation is “not consistent with the presumption of consistent \\nexpression” (IAD reasons, at para. 23). The terms “security” and “security \\ngrounds” in s. 34 must have different meanings from the terms “the security \\nof Canada” or “national security” used elsewhere in the IRPA, including in \\nthe phrase “being a danger to the security of Canada” in s. 34(1)(d), which \\nwould otherwise be redundant. \\n\\uf0b7 The dictionary definition of “security”, which includes a “secure condition \\nor feeling”, provides useful guidance (para. 25). This is a “broad definition” \\nthat “does not necessarily incorporate a national security element” \\n(para. 25). \\n\\uf0b7 Obiter comments in prior cases tend to support the Minister of Public \\nSafety and Emergency Preparedness’ positio n on the interpretation of \\ns. 34(1)(e) (para. 27 (emphasis added), citing El Werfalli v. Canada (Public \\nSafety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 FC 612, [2014] 4 F.C.R. 673, \\nat para.  75, which stated that “[t]he provision of reasonable grounds to \\nbelieve a n organization may engage in terrorism in the future serves to \\nmaintain national security and public safety  being the object of the \\nsubsection 34(1)”; para.  28 (emphasis added), citing Fuentes v. Canada \\n(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) , 2003 FCT 3 79, [2003] 4 F.C. \\n \\nImmigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I -2, as directed at the “key concepts” of \\n“subversion, terrorism, crimes against humanity, war crimes and ordinary \\ncrimes”). \\n\\uf0b7 Section 36(1)(a) of the IRPA provides for inadmissibility based on the \\ncommission of a criminal offence in Canada, and requires a conviction. \\nSection 34(1)(e) creates a different ground of inadmissibility based on \\nconduct, “described in terms of the danger posed to the lives and safety of \\npersons in Canada” (para.  33). Such conduct is “a small subset of what \\nwould be considered serious criminality in section 36 of the IRPA”, and “is \\ndistinct from criminal law” (para. 33). Sections 34 and 36 “overlap but are \\ndistinct” (para. 38). Section 36 addresses criminal offences, while s.  34 \\naddresses danger posed to the lives and safety of persons in Canada. \\n\\uf0b7 Because inadmissibility is not a criminal sanction, it does not offend \\nCanadian values to find a person inadmissible for acts that were “arguably \\ncriminal, but which did not lead to a criminal conviction” (para.  35). The \\nconduct described in s. 34(1)(e) “is narrowly defined and anchored in terms \\nof the danger posed to Canadians, not to criminal law” (para. 36). \\n(2) Failures of Justification in the IAD’s Reasons \\n[84] Plainly, the IAD’s reasons applied several recognized techniques of \\nstatutory interpretation. The IAD adverted to the modern approach to statutory \\n \\nbroader context of the grounds of inadmissibility in Division 4 of the IRPA; relied on \\na dictionary definition of “security”; considered the presumption of consistent \\nexpression to give the terms “security” and “security grounds” in s.  34(1)(e) a distinct \\nmeaning from the terms “the security of Canada” and “national security” used \\nelsewhere in the IRPA; and considered the only prior decision, a ruling of the ID, that \\nhad interpreted s.  34(1)(e) and was consistent with Mr.  Mason’s position, as well as \\nobiter statements from two Federal Court decisions that it viewed as supporting the \\nMinister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness’ position. On balance, the IAD \\nconcluded that the Minister’s interpretive arguments outweighed Mr. Mason’s. \\n[85] As I will elaborate, although the IAD considered several of Mr.  Mason’s \\narguments, it failed to address significant legal constraints that he had raised in his \\nwritten submissions to the IAD: (1) two points of statutory context, and (2) the broad \\nconsequences of its decision. The IAD’s decision also failed to address (3) constraints \\nimposed by international law that s.  3(3)(f) of the IRPA requires to be considered in \\ninterpreting and applying the legislation. These omissions establish that the IAD’s \\ndecision was unreasonable. \\n(a) Failure to Address Two Significant Points of Statutory Context \\n[86] The IAD failed to address two significant points of statutory context that \\nMr. Mason raised before the IAD in support of his argument that s. 34(1)(e) requires a \\nnexus wit h national security or the security of Canada. Together, these omissions \\n \\n[87] First, Mr. Mason submitted before the IAD that s. 34(1)(e) requires a nexus \\nwith national security or the security of Canada partly be cause the ministerial relief \\nfrom inadmissibility under s.  34 (security grounds) is narrower than that available \\nunder s. 36 (serious criminality and criminality). He claimed that this narrower relief \\nsuggests that s.  34 is a “grave” form of inadmissibilit y concerned with “national \\nsecurity” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 30). \\n[88] Mr. Mason submitted as follows. If a foreign national is inadmissible on \\nsecurity grounds under s.  34, the relief available is narrow: the Minister of Public \\nSafety and Emergency Preparedness may declare that the matters referred to in s.  34 \\n“do not constitute inadmissibility in respect of the foreign national if they satisfy the \\nMinister that it is not contrary to the national interest” (IRPA, s. 42.1(1)). But a foreign \\nnational inadmissible under s. 36 for being convicted of a criminal offence in Canada \\nmay seek broader relief: they may be granted ministerial relief from inadmissibility on \\nhumanitarian and compassionate grounds (s. 25(1)), and may not be found inadmissible \\nif a record suspensi on for the conviction is in effect under the Criminal Records Act, \\nR.S.C. 1985, c. C-47 (IRPA, s. 36(3)(b)). \\n[89] Here, for example, because Mr.  Mason was not convicted  of a criminal \\noffence and his alleged conduct would make him inadmissible under the IAD’s \\ninterpretation of s. 34(1)(e), he could seek relief from inadmissibility only if he satisfied \\nthe Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness that it is in the “national \\n \\nconduct, he could have applied for ministerial relief from inadmissibility on \\nhumanitarian and compassionate grounds, and he would not have been inadmissible at \\nall had he been convicted of a criminal offence and later pardoned under the Criminal \\nRecords Act. \\n[90] Mr. Mason argued that because the relief available to persons inadmissible \\non security grounds under s.  34 is narrower than the relief available to persons \\ninadmissible for criminality under s.  36, s.  34 was among the “grave forms of \\ninadmissibility” and should “be interpreted in the context of national security” (A.R., \\nvol. II, at p. 30). \\n[91] The IAD’s reasons, read with sensitivity and in light of the record, did not \\naddress this important contextual argument. While perhaps not in itself determinative, \\nthis argument supported Mr.  Mason’s position and imposed a significant legal \\nconstraint on the interpretation of s. 34(1)(e). \\n[92] Second, Mr. Mason submitted before the IAD that s.  34(1)(e) requires a \\nnexus with national security or the security of Canada partly  because the Minister of \\nCitizenship and Immigration must consider different criteria when conducting a \\n“pre-removal risk assessmen[t]” for a foreign national found inadmissible under s.  34 \\n(security grounds) and under s.  36 (serious criminality and crimin ality) (A.R., vol. II, \\nat pp. 30-31). He submitted that in an assessment involving s.  36 the Minister must \\nconsider whether the person poses a danger to the public in Canada. In contrast, in an \\n \\ndanger to the security of Canada. He claimed that this distinction supported his position \\nthat the security grounds under s. 34 require a nexus to national security or the security \\nof Canada.  \\n[93] A pre-removal risk assessment is a process u nder the IRPA by which a \\nperson subject to a removal order may apply to the Minister of Citizenship and \\nImmigration for protection, resulting in refugee protection or a stay of the removal \\norder (ss. 112 and 114(1)). In any application for a pre -removal risk assessment, the \\nMinister must consider the danger that the person would be subjected to torture, the \\nrisk to their life, and the risk they would be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or \\npunishment (s.  97). For persons found inadmissible under s.  36(1) for serious \\ncriminality, the Minister must also consider “whether they are a danger to the public in \\nCanada” (s. 113(d)(i)). But for persons found inadmissible on security grounds under \\ns. 34, the Minister must, in addition to the s.  97 factors, consi der “whether the \\napplication should be refused because of the nature and severity of acts committed by \\nthe applicant or because of the danger that the applicant constitutes to the security of \\nCanada” (s. 113(d)(ii)). \\n[94] Mr. Mason argued before the IAD that th ese diverging considerations for \\npre-removal risk assessments suggest that Parliament contemplated that conduct \\ncaptured by s. 36 poses a danger to the public in Canada , while conduct captured by \\n \\nthat this supported his position that the security grounds under s. 34 require a nexus to \\nnational security or the security of Canada. \\n[95] Again, the IAD’s reasons did not address this important contextual \\nargument, which, while not in itself determinative, supported Mr. Mason’s position and \\nimposed a significant legal constraint on the interpretation of s. 34(1)(e). \\n[96] The Federal Court accepted that the IAD failed to address these two \\nimportant contextual arguments that Mr.  Mason had  raised (para.  53). The Federal \\nCourt of Appeal disagreed, stating that the IAD had considered these two arguments \\n“implicitly” (para. 59). In its view, “[t]o the extent that the [IAD] failed to mention \\nsome elements in its analysis of text, context and pu rpose, this was not a fundamental \\ngap” (para. 59). The Court of Appeal said that “although one can quibble that certain \\nelements of text, context and purpose were not mentioned in the reasons”, the court \\nwas “confident from the quality of the [IAD]’s overall reasoning that it considered them \\nto be outweighed by other elements” (para. 59). \\n[97] I respectfully disagree with the Court of Appeal. I see no basis to conclude \\nthat the IAD considered these two important points of statutory context, even \\nimplicitly. Mr.  Mason expressly raised both points as core planks supporting his \\nposition. The IAD’s failure to address them, while addressing other points, casts into \\ndoubt whether it was alert and sensitive to these issues ( Vavilov, at paras.  127-28). \\nReasons are the primary mechanism for the IAD to demonstrate that it actually listened \\n \\nmeaningfully grapple with — two key arguments that Mr.  Mason had raised. The \\nIAD’s reasons therefore fai led to meet Vavilov’s standard of responsive justification \\n(para. 127). \\n(b) Failure to Address Potentially Broad Consequences \\n[98] The IAD also failed to address Mr.  Mason’s submission that interpreting \\ns. 34(1)(e) without a nexus to national security or the securi ty of Canada would result \\nin two broad consequences, which he claimed ran afoul of the principle of statutory \\ninterpretation that a legislature does not intend to produce absurd consequences (Rizzo, \\nat para.  27; Vavilov, at para.  120). The IAD’s failure to  address these two broad \\nconsequences involves another failure of responsive justification.  \\n[99] First, Mr. Mason submitted that interpreting s. 34(1)(e) without a nexus to \\nnational security or the security of Canada would mean that “any act of violence against \\nanother individual would presumably result in one of the most grave forms of \\ninadmissibility” (A.R., vol. II, at p.  31). The acts of violence caught by s.  34(1)(e) \\nwould, he submitted, extend from “domestic altercations” to “bar fights and schoolyard \\nfights” (p. 31). I note that unlike a criminal conviction triggering inadmissibility under \\ns. 36, which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the facts triggering \\ninadmissibility under s. 34 are subject to the much lower standard of “facts for which \\nthere are reasonable grounds to believe that they have occurred, are occurring or may \\noccur” (IRPA, s. 33). Thus, s. 34(1)(e) would extend to any “acts of violence” — past, \\n \\nin Canada”. Mr. Mason submitted that it would be absurd for such acts to be captured \\nby s. 34(1)(e). \\n[100] Unlike the Federal Court of Appeal, I do not read the IAD’s reasons as \\nhaving addressed this argument. The Federal Court of Appeal interpreted the IAD’s \\nreasons as interpreting “safety” as “something approaching the level of a threat to life, \\nnot just minor harm” (para.  57). The court based this conclusion on the IAD’s \\nobservation that s. 34(1)(e) is “narrowly defined and anchored in terms of the danger \\nposed to Canadians, not to criminal law”. But the IAD made this statement in \\nexplaining that immigration consequences under the IRPA are distinct from criminal \\nsanctions and are subject to different evidentiary thresholds; it did not say that \\ns. 34(1)(e) applied  only to a small class of especially serious violent conduct \\napproaching a threat to life. As the IAD explained: \\n. . . immigration consequences under the IRPA are not criminal sanctions. \\nCriminal law and the IRPA have different objects. The IRPA operates \\nunder a different scheme including, for example, a lower evidentiary \\nthreshold. A person can be found inadmissible for conduct even if they \\nhave not been convicted criminally for that conduct. The conduct described \\nin paragraph 34(1)(e) is narrowly defined and anchored in terms of the \\ndanger posed to Canadians, not to criminal law. [para. 36] \\n[101] With respect, the Court of Appeal effectively buttressed the IAD’s reasons \\nto provide a justification that the IAD did not itself provide, contrary to Vavilov’s \\ndirection that “it is not open to a reviewing court to disregard the flawed basis for a \\ndecision and substitute its own justification for the outcome” (para.  96). This Court \\n \\ndecision maker to abdicate its responsibility to justify to the affected party, in a manner \\nthat is transparent and intelligible, the basis on which it arrived at a particular \\nconclusion” (para. 96). \\n[102] As for the second broad consequence, Mr.  Mason submitted t o the IAD \\nthat if s. 34(1)(e) is interpreted without a nexus to national security or the security of \\nCanada, it would do an “end -run around the limitations under s.  36(3)(e) with respect \\nto youth offences” (A.R., vol. II, at pp.  31-32). Section 36(3)(e) of the IRPA provides \\nthat young persons who are permanent residents or foreign nationals found guilty under \\nthe Young Offenders Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. Y-1, or who received a youth sentence under \\nthe Youth Criminal Justice Act , S.C. 2002, c. 1, cannot be found inadmissible under \\ns. 36(1) (serious criminality) or s.  36(2) (criminality). In effect, under s.  36(3)(e), \\nParliament exempted young persons from inadmissibility for most criminal offences. \\nBut on the IAD’s interpretation of s. 34(1)(e), young persons can be found inadmissible \\nfor any acts of violence that would or might engage the lives or safety of persons in \\nCanada, even without a nexus to national security or the security of Canada, and even \\nwithout a criminal conviction. \\n[103] Neither the IAD nor the Federal Court of Appeal addressed this \\nincompatibility of the IAD’s interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) with the scheme for the \\ninadmissibility of young persons under the IRPA. This omission was also not a minor \\naspect of s. 34(1)(e)’s interpretive context, and should have been addressed. \\n \\n[104] Finally, the IAD failed to address the legal constraints imposed by \\ninternational law on its interpretation of s.  34(1)(e). As I will explain, t he IAD’s \\ninterpretation allows foreign nationals to be returned to countries where they may face \\npersecution, contrary to Canada’s non-refoulement obligation in Article 33 of the \\nRefugee Convention . By contrast, interpreting s.  34(1)(e) as requiring a nexu s with \\nnational security or the security of Canada means that a removal order would not breach \\nArticle 33. Although this argument was not presented to the IAD, the IAD was required \\nby its home statute to interpret and apply the IRPA in a manner that compli es with \\nCanada’s international human rights obligations, including Canada’s non-refoulement \\nobligation under Article 33 of the Refugee Convention. \\n[105] Vavilov highlighted that international law may be an “important constraint \\non an administrative decision make r”, including through the presumption of statutory \\ninterpretation that “legislation is presumed to operate in conformity with Canada’s \\ninternational obligations” (para.  114). Canada has ratified both the 1951 Refugee \\nConvention and the 1967 Refugee Protocol (Németh v. Canada (Justice) , 2010 SCC \\n56, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 281, at para.  17). These international human rights instruments to \\nwhich Canada is a party trigger the interpretive presumption of conformity with \\ninternational law. \\n[106] The presumption of conformity with international law assumes added force \\nwhen interpreting the IRPA, because Parliament has made its “presumed intent to \\n \\nIRPA (B010 v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 58, [2015] 3 S.C.R. \\n704, at para.  49). First, s.  3(2)(b) of the IRPA expressly identifies one of the IRPA’s \\nobjectives as being “to fulfil Canada’s international legal obligations with respect to \\nrefugees and affirm Canada’s commitment to international efforts to provide assistance \\nto those in need of resettlement”. Indeed, this Court has described the IRPA as the \\n“main legislative vehicle for implementing Canada’s international refugee obligations” \\n(Németh, at para. 21). Second, s. 3(3)(f) of the IRPA instructs courts and administrative \\ndecision makers to construe and apply the IRPA in a manner that “complies with \\ninternational human rights instruments to which Canada is signatory” ( B010, at \\npara. 49). This Court has stated that “[t]here can be no doubt that the Refugee \\nConvention is such an instrument, building as it does on the right of persons to seek \\nand to enjoy asylum from persecution in other countries as set out in art.  14 of the \\nUniversal Declaration of Hu man Rights, G.A. Res. 217 A (III), U.N. Doc. A/810, at \\n71 (1948)” (para. 49). As a result, the Refugee Convention is “determinative of how the \\nIRPA must be interpreted and applied, in the absence of a contrary legislative intention” \\n(de Guzman v. Canada (M inister of Citizenship and Immigration) , 2005 FCA 436, \\n[2006] 3 F.C.R. 655, at para. 87; B010, at para. 49).  \\n[107] The centrepiece of the Refugee Convention is contained in the provisions \\nrelating to “expulsion and return” (Németh, at para.  18). Article 33, whi ch has been \\nexpressly incorporated into the IRPA (s. 115), bars the expulsion or return of a refugee, \\n \\nto pose a danger to the security of the host country or are convicted of a serious crime. \\nArticle 33 of the Refugee Convention provides: \\nArticle 33 \\n \\nProhibition of Expulsion or Return (“Refoulement”) \\n \\n1. No Contracting State shall expel or return (“refouler”) a refugee in any \\nmanner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom \\nwould be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, \\nmembership of a particular social group or political opinion. \\n  \\n2. The benefit of the present provision may not, however, be claimed by a \\nrefugee whom there are reasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to \\nthe security of the country in which he is, or who, having been convicted \\nby a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to \\nthe community of that country. \\n[108] Article 33(1) en shrines the principle of non-refoulement, which has been \\ndescribed as “the cornerstone of the international refugee protection regime”, and \\nwhich, generally, “prohibits the direct or indirect removal of refugees to a territory \\nwhere they run a risk of bein g subjected to human rights violations” ( Németh, at \\nparas. 18-19). Article 33(2), which operates as a limited exception to the principle of \\nnon-refoulement in Article 33(1), allows a person to be removed in exceptional \\ncircumstances: when there are reasonable grounds for regarding the person as a danger \\nto the security of the country in which they are, or when the person is convicted of a \\nserious crime and is a danger to the community of that country (see Febles v. Canada \\n(Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 SCC 68, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 431, at para. 25). Article \\n42 of the Refugee Convention  further stipulates that ratifying states may not make \\n \\nprinciple of non-refoulement is generally recognized as a norm of customary \\ninternational law (see Prosecutor v. Germain Katanga, ICC-01/04-01/07, Decision on \\nthe application for the interim release of detained Witnesses,  1 October 2013 (Trial \\nChamber II), at para.  30; Zaoui v. Attorney -General (No. 2) , [2005] 1 N.Z.L.R. 690 \\n(C.A.), at paras. 34-35; S. E. Lauterpacht and D. Bethlehem, “The scope and content \\nof the principle of non-refoulement: Opinion”, in E. Feller, V. Türk and F. Nicholson, \\neds., Refugee Protection in International Law:  UNHCR’s Global Consultations on \\nInternational Protection  (2003), 87, at paras.  193-253; H. Lambert, “Customary \\nRefugee Law”, in C. Costello, M. Foster and J. McAdam, eds., The Oxford Handbook \\nof International Refugee Law  (2021), 240, at pp.  242-49; and United Nations High \\nCommissioner for Refugees, Advisory Opinion on the Extraterritorial Application of \\nNon-Refoulement Obligations under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of \\nRefugees and its 1967 Protocol (2007), at paras. 14-16). \\n[109] The IAD’s interpretation allows a foreign national found inadmissible \\nunder s. 34(1)(e) to be subject to refoulement contrary to Article 33(1) of the Refugee \\nConvention. On the IAD’s interpretation, a foreign national can be deported to \\npersecution once they are found inadmissible under s.  34(1)(e), without a finding that \\nthe person poses a danger to the security of Canada or even if they have not been \\nconvicted of a serious offence. Such a person would be entitled to the benefit of \\nArticle 33(1) of the Refugee Convention, as the exceptions under Article 33(2) would \\nnot apply: on the IAD’s approach to inadmissibility under s.  34(1)(e), there need not \\n \\nCanada, or for them t o have been “convicted by a final judgment of a particularly \\nserious crime”. \\n[110] A person facing such a removal order would not be protected from \\nrefoulement under Article 33(1) through the IRPA’s pre -removal risk assessment \\nprocess. Although such a person may  apply to the Minister of Citizenship and \\nImmigration for a pre -removal risk assessment ( IRPA, s.  112), the grounds that the \\nMinister must consider in assessing the risk to the person if the removal order is not \\nstayed do not include those under Article 33 (1) of the Refugee Convention . The \\nMinister does not consider whether the person is a “Convention refugee”, that is, \\nwhether the person has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, \\nnationality, membership in a particular social gro up, or political opinion (s.  96). \\nInstead, the Minister need consider only (1) whether the application for a stay of the \\nremoval order should be refused because of the nature and severity of acts committed \\nby the person or because of the danger that the pe rson constitutes to the security of \\nCanada, and (2) whether the person’s removal would subject them to a danger of \\ntorture, to a risk to their life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment \\n(ss. 97(1) and 113(d)(ii)). Thus, as fairly conce ded by the respondent Minister, the \\nMinister does not consider the forms of persecution described in Article 33(1) (R.F., at \\npara. 106). And while there are several “safety valves” under the IRPA that provide \\ndiscretionary exemptions from the application o f the general ineligibility rules under \\nthe IRPA (see Canadian Council for Refugees v. Canada (Citizenship and \\n \\ndetract from the concern that the IAD’s interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) would, as a general \\nrule, allow for a removal order without protection from refoulement, contrary to \\nArticle 33(1) of the Refugee Convention. \\n[111] As a result, interpreting s.  34(1)(e) of the IRPA as not requiring a nexus \\nwith national security or the security of Canada — as did the IAD — could subject \\npersons to refoulement contrary to Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention . By \\ncontrast, interpreting s.  34(1)(e) as requiring a nexus with national security or the \\nsecurity of Canada would trigger the ex ception in Article 33(2) to the ability to claim \\nthe protection of Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention, and thus a removal order in \\nsuch circumstances would not breach Canada’s obligation of non-refoulement. \\n[112] The respondent Minister contends that s.  115(1) and (2) of the IRPA \\noperate as a safeguard against refoulement and “fulfil[l] Canada’s international \\nobligations by ensuring that it is only in exceptional cases that a Convention refugee or \\na protected person will lose the benefit of non-refoulement and be removed from \\nCanada” (R.F., at para.  125). Section 115(1) prohibits removal of certain persons to \\npersecution, and s. 115(2) provides for limited exceptions to that prohibition: \\nProtection \\n \\n115 (1) A protected person or a person who is recognized as a Convention \\nrefugee by another country to which the person may be returned shall not \\nbe removed from Canada to a country where they would be at risk of \\npersecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a \\nparticular social group or political opinion or at risk of torture or cruel and \\nunusual treatment or punishment. \\n \\nExceptions \\n \\n(2) Subsection (1) does not apply in the case of a person \\n \\n(a) who is inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality and who \\nconstitutes, in the opinion of the Minister, a danger to the public in \\nCanada; or \\n \\n(b) who is inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or \\ninternational rights or organized criminality if, in the opinion of the \\nMinister, the person should not be allowed to remain in Canada o n the \\nbasis of the nature and severity of acts committed or of danger to the \\nsecurity of Canada. \\nAccording to the Minister, if a person inadmissible under s.  34(1)(e) is subject to an \\nenforceable removal order, s.  115(1) and (2) will prevent their refoulement except in \\nlimited circumstances, and so s. 34(1)(e) need not be interpreted as requiring a link to \\nnational security or the security of Canada.  \\n[113] I disagree with the Minister’s submission for two reasons. First, while the \\nMinister is correct tha t the s.  115(2) exceptions apply in limited circumstances, they \\nnonetheless allow refoulement of persons inadmissible under s.  34(1)(e) in \\ncircumstances outside the scope of the Article 33(2) exceptions. As discussed above, \\nArticle 33(2) provides for excep tions to the non-refoulement principle for persons \\nreasonably regarded as a danger to the security of the host country, or who are convicted \\nof a particularly serious crime and are a danger to the community. But s.  115(2) \\ncountenances refoulement outside t hose circumstances: it only requires that the \\nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration be of the opinion that the person should not \\n \\ncommitted, or (2) danger to the security of Canada. It thus permits the Minister to allow \\nrefoulement based on “the nature and severity” of acts not linked to “the security of the \\ncountry”. \\n[114] Second, s. 115(1) affords protection to a narrower set of persons than are \\nprotected from refoulement under the Refugee Convention. Section 115(1) only affords \\nprotection to a person recognized as having refugee status: “[a] protected person or a \\nperson who is recognized as a Convention refugee by another country to which the \\nperson may be returned”. By contrast, Article 33 affords protection to “a refugee”, and \\nthus does not require a prior recognition of refugee status ( Refugee Convention , \\nArticle 1; Refugee Protocol, Article 1; G. v. G., [2021] UKSC 9, [2022] A.C. 544, at \\npara. 81 (“The obligation not to refou le an individual arises by virtue of the fact that \\ntheir circumstances meet the definition of ‘refugee’, not by reason of the recognition \\nby a contracting state that the definition is met.”)). As a result, if s.  34(1)(e) applies to \\nconduct not linked to na tional security or the security of Canada, s.  115(1) allows the \\nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration to subject refugee claimants to refoulement \\ncontrary to Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention. \\n[115] That neither Mr.  Mason nor Mr.  Dleiow is a refugee clai mant does not \\ndetract from this conclusion. The Refugee Convention  imposes an important legal \\nconstraint on the interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) generally, irrespective of whether the \\n \\n[116] The Federal Court of Appeal declined to consider this argument because it \\nhad not been made to the IAD, and because it said that “certain background documents \\nand other instruments needed to understand any international obligations are not in \\nevidence before us” (paras.  73-74). The court did not say what documents and \\ninstruments might be missing.  \\n[117] In any event, the role of the Refugee Convention  in constraining the \\ninterpretation of the IRPA is a question of law, one that Parliament by s.  3(3)(f) has \\nexpressly directed a court or administrative decision maker to consider. The IAD’s \\nfailure to consider this issue did not involve the omission of a “minor aspect of the \\ninterpretive context” ( Vavilov, at para.  122). Rather, it involved the omission of the \\nprinciple of non-refoulement — “the cornerstone of the international refugee protection \\nregime”, and a critical legal constraint on interpretation of the IRPA, one that \\nParliament has decreed must be considered in construing and applying the IRPA. This \\ncrucial omission made the IAD’s decision unreasonable. \\nD. Conclusion and Remedy \\n[118] The IAD’s reasons in Mr. Mason’s case failed to address critical points of \\nstatutory context and the broad consequences of its interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) of the \\nIRPA, all of which Mr. Mason had highlighted in his written submissions to the IAD. \\nThese omissions were significant, not minor; they involved a failure of “responsive \\njustification” by the IAD. The IAD also failed to interpret and apply s.  34(1)(e) in \\n \\nConvention, a matter that Parliament has decreed it must consider. Cumulatively, these \\nomissions rendered the IAD’s decision unreasonable.  \\n[119] The ID’s decision in Mr. Dleoiw’s case, which simply followed the IAD’s \\ninterpretation of s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA in Mr. Mason’s case, was unreasonable for the \\nsame reasons. \\n[120] Vavilov cautioned that although a court conducting a reasonableness \\nreview is not tasked with determining the “correct” interpretation of a disputed \\nstatutory provision, it may become clear in the course of conducting a judicial review \\nthat the relevant constraints bearing on the decision “so overwhelmingly” favour one \\ninterpretation that there is room for only one reasonable interpretation of the provision \\nat issue (para.  124, citing approvingly Nova Tube , at para.  61 (CanLII), per \\nLaskin J.A.). This Court noted that, based on the applicable constraints, a particular \\noutcome may be “inevitable” ( Vavilov, at para.  142). In such a case, while “a court \\nshould generally pause before definitively pronouncing upon the interpretation of a \\nprovision entrusted to an administrative decision maker”, it would serve no useful \\npurpose to remit the matter to the original decision maker (para.  124). The Court \\nreached this conclusion not as the starting point of its reasonableness review, but rather \\nas a result of a proper reasonableness review when considering the appropriate remedy. \\n[121] That is also the case here. The relevant legal constraints cumulatively point \\noverwhelmingly to only one reasonable interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) — the provision \\n \\nsupported by the placement of s. 34(1)(e) amid other “security grounds” in s. 34, all of \\nwhich have a link to national security or the security of Canada. And although the IAD \\nnoted that some interpretive constraints point in the other direction, the two critical \\npoints of statutory context that the IAD failed to consider, and especially, the legal \\nconstraints imposed by international law, overwhelmingly support the opposite \\nconclusion: s. 34(1)(e) can be invoked to render a person inadmissible only when their \\n“acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada” \\nhave a nexus with national security or the security of Canada. \\n[122] As a result, the decision of the IAD in Mr. Mason’s case and of the ID in \\nMr. Dleiow’s case were unreasonable and should be quashed. Because the Minister has \\nnot alleged that Mr.  Mason or Mr. Dle iow engaged in acts of violence with a link to \\nnational security or the security of Canada, s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA does not provide a \\nlegal basis for the inadmissibility of either person. And because the Minister has not \\nalleged any other basis for their inadmissibility, there is no need to remit either decision \\nto the ID or IAD for redetermination. \\nVI. Disposition \\n[123] I would allow the appeals, set aside the judgments of the Federal Court of \\nAppeal and allow the applications for judicial review. In Mr. Mason’s appeal, I would \\nquash the IAD decision thus restoring the ID decision. In Mr. Dleiow’s appeal, I would \\nquash the ID decision and deportation order. Since neither appellant requested costs, I \\n \\nThe following are the reasons delivered by \\n \\n CÔTÉ J. —  \\nI. Introduction \\n[124] I agree with my colleague’s disposition of these appeals. Inadmissibility \\nunder s.  34(1)(e) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act , S.C.  2001, c.  27 \\n(“IRPA”), requires a nexus between the relevant act of violence a nd with national \\nsecurity or the security of Canada (see paras.  11 and 121). However, I would review \\nthe Immigration Appeal Division’s (“IAD”) interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) on a standard \\nof correctness, as submitted by the appellant Mr.  Earl Mason and the interveners the \\nCanadian Association of Refugee Lawyers and the Canadian Council for Refugees. \\n[125] In Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC \\n65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, this Court held that reviewing courts should derogate from the \\npresumption of reasonableness review where required by (1) a clear indication of \\nlegislative intent or (2) the rule of law (para.  10). In my view, the rule of law \\nrequires — and Parliament intended for appellate courts to provide  — definitive, \\ncorrect answers to legal questions certified under s.  74(d) of the IRPA. By definition, \\nthese are questions that transcend the interests of the parties and raise issues of broad \\nsignificance within Canada’s immigration and refugee protection scheme (see \\nLunyamila v. C anada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) , 2018 FCA 22, \\n \\n[126] In Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) , \\n[1998] 1 S.C.R. 982, this Court noted that the certified question regime would be \\n“incoherent” if the standard of review were anything other than correctness (para. 43). \\nThis is exemplified by the companion appeals before us. The IAD’s interpretation of \\ns. 34(1)(e) in Mr.  Mason’s case, subsequently applied to Mr.  Dleiow, would \\nsignificantly expand the grounds on which foreign nationals or permanent residents \\nmay be deported from Canada. It would allow foreign nationals to be returned to \\ncountries where they may face persecution, in a manner contrary to Canada’s \\nobligations under the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees , Can. T.S. 1969 \\nNo. 6 (see Jamal J.’s reasons, at paras. 104-17). Parliament did not intend for appellate \\ncourts, as the Federal Court of Appeal did in this case, to defer to such interpretations \\nwhere they may be “reasonable”, but are nonetheless wrong in law (see Pushpanathan, \\nat para. 43). \\n[127] To be consistent with the principles and framework set out in Vavilov, I \\nwould recognize a new category of correctness review: when appellate courts decide a \\n“serious question of general importance” certified under s. 74(d) of the IRPA. \\nII. Analysis \\nA. The Standard of Review for Certified Questions Under the IRPA Is Undecided \\nPost-Vavilov \\n \\n[128] Prior to Vavilov, this Court was inconsistent in its approach to certified \\nquestions. In Pushpanathan, the majority of this Court held that the certified question \\nregime under s. 83(1) of the former Immigration Act , R.S.C. 1985, c.  I-2 — the \\npredecessor to s. 74(d) of the IRPA — would be “incoherent if the standard of review \\nwere anything other than correctness” (para.  43). Writing for the majority, \\nBastarache J. noted that the only way in which the certification procedure could be \\ngiven its explicitly articulated scope wa s if courts were permitted to substitute their \\nown answers for those of the Immigration and Refugee Board in respect of questions \\nof general importance. \\n[129] Under the pre-Vavilov contextual approach, this Court departed from the \\napproach taken in Pushpanathan in some subsequent cases, though not in most. In \\nBaker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) , [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, the \\nmajority of this Court applied the intermediate standard of review of reasonableness \\nsimpliciter, distinguishing Pushpanathan based on the “highly discretionary and \\nfact-based nature” of the Minister’s decision to refuse to exempt the appellant in that \\ncase from deportation on humanitarian and compassionate grounds ( Baker, at \\nparas. 61-62). Importantly, however, the Court answ ered the certified question before \\nit definitively: \\n Simpson J. certified the following as a “serious question of general \\nimportance” under s.  83(1) of the Immigration Act : “Given that the \\nImmigration Act does not expressly incorporate the language of Canada’s \\ninternational obligations with respect to the International Convention on \\n \\ninterests of the Canadian child as a primary consideration in assessing an \\napplicant under s. 114(2) of the Immigration Act?” \\n \\n. . . \\n \\n The certified question asks whether the best interests of children must \\nbe a primary consideration when assessing an applicant under s. 114(2) and \\nthe Regulations. The principles discussed above indicate that, for the \\nexercise of the discretion to fall within the standard of reasonableness, the \\ndecision-maker should consider children’s best interests as an important \\nfactor, give them substantial weight, and be alert, alive and sensitive to \\nthem. [Emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted; paras. 9 and 75.] \\n[130] The Court also applied a standard of review of reasonableness in Agraira \\nv. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) , 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 \\nS.C.R. 559, on the basis that the Minister’s decision under the forme r s. 34(2) of the \\nIRPA was discretionary (para.  50). In Kanthasamy v. Canada (Citizenship and \\nImmigration), 2015 SCC 61, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 909, the majority of this Court held that \\nthe fact that the reviewing judge “considered the question to be of general importance” \\nwas “relevant, but not determinative” of the standard of review (para. 44). “Despite the \\npresence of a certified question, the appropriate standard of review” in that case was \\nreasonableness (ibid., citing Baker, at para. 62). \\n[131] However, as the Ca nadian Association of Refugee Lawyers notes in its \\nfactum, Agraira and Kanthasamy are outliers. The Court applied a standard of \\ncorrectness in Chieu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) , 2002 SCC \\n3, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 84, at para. 26, and Hilewitz v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and \\nImmigration), 2005 SCC 57, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 706, at para. 71. In other cases, the Court \\n \\naddressing the standard of review (see Ezokola v. Canada (Citizenship and \\nImmigration), 2013 SCC 40, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 678, at paras.  6-9; Febles v. Canada \\n(Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 SCC 68, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 431, at paras. 6 and 60) \\nor after finding that it was unnecessary to resolve the issue ( B010 v. Canada \\n(Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 58, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 704, at paras. 26 and 76; \\nTran v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2017 SCC 50, [2017] 2 \\nS.C.R. 289, at paras. 23, 53 and 56). \\n[132] Relying on pre-Vavilov authorities, my colleague says that this Court has \\n“concluded in the immigration context” that the standard of review for certified \\nquestions is reasonableness (para.  51, citing Kanthasamy and Baker). With respect, I \\ndisagree. \\n[133] First, this Court did not endorse or even cite Kanthasamy in Vavilov. It \\nrelied on Baker in Vavilov, but  for reasons unrelated to the determination of the \\nstandard of review. \\n[134] Second, prior to Vavilov, this Court consistently provided definitive \\nanswers to certified questions of statutory interpret ation (see, e.g., Pushpanathan, at \\nparas. 75-76; Baker, at para.  75; Chieu, at para.  90; Ezokola, at paras.  6-9; Febles, at \\npara. 60; Hilewitz, at para. 71; B010, at para. 76; Tran, at para. 56; see also Vavilov v. \\nCanada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FCA 132, [2018] 3 F.C.R. 75, at para. 37; \\nKanthasamy v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FCA 113, [2015] 1 F.C.R. \\n \\nIndeed, prior to considering the standard of review, Abella J., who wrote the majority \\nreasons, engaged in a lengthy interpretive exercise with respect to s. 25(1) of the IRPA \\n(see paras.  10-41). In dissent, Moldaver  J. (Wagner  J. (as he then was) concurring) \\nlamented that the majority had adopted a “do as we say, not what we do” approach to \\nreasonableness review: \\n In particular, I am concerned that my colleague has not given the \\nOfficer’s reasons the deference which, time and again, this Court has said \\nthey deserve. In her reasons, she parses the  Officer’s decision for legal \\nerrors, resolves ambiguities against the Officer, and reweighs the evidence. \\nLest we be accused of adopting a “do as we say, not what we do” approach \\nto reasonableness review , this approach fails to heed the admonition in \\nNewfoundland and Labrador Nurses  — that reviewing courts must be \\ncautious about substituting their own view of the proper outcome by \\ndesignating certain omissions in the reasons to be fatal (para. 17). As is the \\ncase with every other court, this Court has no l icence to find an officer’s \\ndecision unreasonable simply because it considers the result unpalatable \\nand would itself have come to a different result.  [Emphasis added; \\npara. 112.] \\n[135] Following Kanthasamy, a unanimous Court held in Tran that an \\nadministrative interpretation of the “serious criminality” provisions set out in \\ns. 36(1)(a) of the IRPA could not stand under either standard of review (para. 23). The \\nCourt did not endorse or cite Kanthasamy and, again, provided definitive answers to \\nthe two questions of general importance certified by the Federal Court: \\n1. Is a conditional sentence of imprison ment imposed pursuant to the \\nregime set out in ss.  742 to 742.7 of the Criminal Code  a “term of \\nimprisonment” under s. 36(1)(a) of the IRPA? \\n \\n― No. \\n \\n2. Does the phrase “punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of \\nat least 10 years” in s. 36(1)(a) of the IRPA refer to the maximum term \\nof imprisonment available at the time the person was sentenced or to \\nthe maximum term of imprisonment under the law in force at the time \\nadmissibility is determined? \\n \\n―  It refers to the maximum term of imprisonment available at the time of \\nthe commission of the offence. [para. 56] \\n[136] In sum, the weight of authority confirms that prior to Vavilov, this Court \\nrepeatedly answer ed certified questions definitively and without deference to \\nadministrative decision makers. I therefore disagree that, “[a]s a matter of precedent”, \\nreasonableness review applies (Jamal J.’s reasons, at para. 51). \\n[137] In any event, Vavilov overtook prior jurisprudence (para. 143; see Society \\nof Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada v. Entertainment Software \\nAssociation, 2022 SCC 30, at para.  25). The jurisprudence discussed above must be \\nanalyzed in light of the principles and framework set out in Vavilov. \\n(2) Vavilov \\n[138] In Vavilov, this Court  recognized five categories of correctness review, \\nbased on either legislative intent (legislated standards of review and statutory appeal \\nmechanisms) or the rule of law (constitutional questions, general questions of  law of \\ncentral importance to the legal system as a whole, and questions regarding jurisdictional \\nboundaries between administrative bodies) (paras.  17 and 69). However, it was \\n \\n(para. 70). And indeed, in Society of Composers, this Court recognized a new category: \\n“. . . when courts and administrative bodies have concurrent first instance jurisdiction \\nover a legal issue in a statute. Applying correctness to these issues accor ds with \\nlegislative intent and promotes the rule of law” (para. 28). \\n[139] The issue in Vavilov reached the Federal Court of Appeal by way of a \\ncertified question under s.  22.2(d) of the Citizenship Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.  C-29. The \\nFederal Court of Appeal provided a definitive answer to that question: \\n The proper stated question and my proposed answer to it are as follows: \\n \\nQuestion: Are the words “other representative or employee [in Canada] of \\na foreign government” found in paragraph 3(2)(a) of the Citizenship Act \\nlimited to foreign nationals [falling within these words] who [also] benefit \\nfrom diplomatic privileges and immunities? \\n \\nAnswer: Yes. [para. 90] \\n[140] This Court upheld the Federal Court of Appeal’s decision quashing the \\nRegistrar of Citizenship’s decision t o cancel Mr.  Vavilov’s citizenship certificate \\n(para. 194). The majority of the Court concluded that Mr.  Vavilov’s status was \\ngoverned by s.  3(1)(a) of the Citizenship Act and that he was a Canadian citizen \\n(para. 196). \\n[141] While I acknowledge that our Court a pplied a standard of review of \\n \\nstandard of review for certified questions under the IRPA moving forward. Let me \\nexplain. \\n[142] First, this Court did not discuss the issue of certified questions in Vavilov. \\nAs noted in Society of Composers, when this Court “wanted to reject the possibility of \\na certain correctness category, it did so expressly” (para.  42, citing Vavilov, at \\nparas. 71-72). In my view, the standard of review for certified questions — certainly in \\nthe unique context of the IRPA, as explained below  — remains an open question \\npost-Vavilov. \\n[143] I would note that the Federal Court of Appeal does not view Vavilov as \\ndispositive on this point. To the contrary, in Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. \\nGalindo Camayo, 2022 FCA 50, 468 D.L.R. (4th) 358, the court noted that correctness \\nreview of certified questions would “seem to gain greater credence now that the \\nSupreme Court has held that statutory standards can have a bearing on the standard of \\nreview” (para. 41 (emphasis added)). Writing for the court, Mactavish  J.A. observed \\nthat in Vavilov itself, the Federal Court of Appeal gave a “precise answer, akin to a \\ncorrectness review answer”, to the certified question before it , an approach that this \\nCourt effectively ratified in dismissing the appeal (para.  43). The Federal Court of \\nAppeal in Galindo Camayo appears to have applied a standard of reasonableness based \\non Kanthasamy, not Vavilov (see para. 42). \\n[144] Second, the certified question in Vavilov arose under different legislation, \\n \\nministers, government departments, and agencies, as well as Canada’s largest \\nadministrative tribunal (the Immig ration and Refugee Board) are charged with \\nindependently administering the statutory scheme. In many cases, these separate \\ndecision makers are required to interpret the same statutory provisions. While it is \\nbeyond the scope of these appeals to exhaustively canvass the scheme of the Citizenship \\nAct, the statutory certification process has been widely used under the IRPA to settle \\ndivergent interpretations or disagreements on legal issues of general importance (see \\nHuruglica v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigr ation), 2016 FCA 93, [2016] 4 F.C.R. \\n157, at para. 28). \\n[145] Finally, to say that Vavilov is determinative and that the standard of review \\nfor certified questions is reasonableness would contradict the Vavilov framework itself. \\nAs I explain below, reasonablenes s review of certified questions under the IRPA is \\ninconsistent with both Parliament’s intent and the rule of law. \\nB. Certified Questions Under the IRPA Should Be Recognized as a New Category \\nof Correctness Review \\n(1) Legislative Intent \\n[146] In s.  74(d) of the IRPA, Pa rliament has provided for an “exceptional” \\nappeal (see Pushpanathan, at para.  43) to the Federal Court of Appeal for legal \\nquestions certified as “serious question[s] of general importance”. This indicates \\n \\nquestions, as distinct from all others arising under the IRPA more broadly, to appellate \\nstandards of review (see Society of Composers , at para.  30; Vavilov, at para.  36). \\nParliament’s institutional design choice should be respected by the courts. \\n[147] I do not dispute that s.  74(d) provides for statutory appeals following \\njudicial review decisions. If Parliament had provided for statutory appeals from \\nadministrative decisions directly, certified questions would fit within the existing \\nVavilov category. Nonetheless, as this Court noted in Society of Composers , the \\npresumption of reasonableness review no longer applies where the legislature expressly \\ninvolves the court in the administrative scheme: \\n Reasonableness is the standard of review that, in most instances, gives \\nbest effect to legislative intent. When the legislature has granted exclusive \\njurisdiction to an administrative decision maker, courts presume that the \\nlegislature wanted that decision maker to operate without undue judicial \\ninterference: Vavilov, at para. 24. \\n \\n When the legislature expressly involves the court in the administrative \\nscheme, this presumption no longer applies.  That is why legislated \\nstandards of review and statutory appeal mechanisms give rise to a \\ncorrectness standard of review. Such statutory features indicate legislative \\nintent for judicial involvement and a desire to subject those decisions to \\nappellate standards of review : Vavilov, at para.  36. [Emphasis added; \\nparas. 29-30.] \\n[148] As my colleague acknowledges, the cer tified question regime under the \\nIRPA is a “statutory mechanism” through which an appeal is provided for “in certain \\ncircumstances”, i.e. based on the nature and importance of the legal question at issue \\n(para. 9). Through s. 74(d), Parliament does not “ex clude the courts but rather makes \\n \\nciting Seneca College of Applied Arts and Technology v. Bhadauria , [1981] 2 S.C.R. \\n181, at p.  195). In my view, this strongly rebuts t he presumption of reasonableness \\nreview for this particular type of legal question, in a manner analogous to the existing \\ncategories of correctness review. \\n[149] Prior to Vavilov, the Federal Court of Appeal also adopted the practice of \\nproviding the “definitive  answer to a certified question on a point of statutory \\ninterpretation” (see Kanthasamy, at para.  35). This is consistent with Parliament’s \\nexpress intent for appellate courts to decide certified questions. In Pushpanathan, this \\nCourt discussed Parliament’s intent as follows: \\n First, s.  83(1) would be incoherent if the standard of review were \\nanything other than correctness. The key to the legislative intention as to \\nthe standard of review is the use of the words “a serious question of general \\nimportance” .  . . . The general importance of the question, that is, its \\napplicability to numerous future cases, warrants the review by a court of \\njustice. Would that review serve any purpose if the Court of Appeal were \\nobliged to defer to incorrect decisions of the Bo ard? Is it possible that the \\nlegislator would have provided for an exceptional appeal to the Court of \\nAppeal on questions of “general importance”, but then required that despite \\nthe “general importance” of the question, the court accept decisions of the \\nBoard which are wrong in law, even clearly wrong in law, but not patently \\nunreasonable? [Emphasis in original; para. 43.] \\n[150] The Court then noted that, for the certified question regime to be given its \\nexplicitly legislated scope, appellate courts must be able to answer them correctly: \\nThe only way in which s. 83(1) can be given its explicitly articulated scope \\nis if the Court of Appeal  — and inferentially, the Federal Court, Trial \\nDivision — is permitted to substitute its own opinion for that of the Board \\n \\n[151] I could not agree more. For serious questions of general importance arising \\nunder the IRPA, Parliament did not intend courts to be forced to defer to administrative \\ndecisions that may be “reasonable”, but are wrong in law. As with s. 83(1) of the former \\nImmigration Act, the only way s. 74(d) of the IRPA can be given its explicitly legislated \\nscope is if appellate courts are permitted to substitute their own opinion in respect of \\nserious questions of general importance. \\n[152] The Federal Court of Appeal has struggled with this exact issue since \\nVavilov. In Galindo Camayo, Mactavish J.A. lamented the “misfit between answering \\n[a] certified question properly and conducting reasonableness review” (para. 41): \\n However, the fact that we have certified questions before us gives rise \\nto an awkward situation. Certified questions generally raise questions of \\nlaw, including, as in this case, questions of statutory interpretation. \\nHowever, the questions, as phrased by the Federal Court, require a yes or \\nno answer. This invites correctness review by this Court.  That said, as \\ndescribed above, this Court is required to engage in reasonableness review \\non questions of statutory interpretation. This creates the possibility that, in \\nsome cases, this Court may find the [Refugee Protection Division’s] \\ninterpretation of a statutory provision to be reasonable, yet this Court may \\nsay something entirely different in providing its own view of the matter in \\nanswering the cer tified question  — something that the Supreme Court \\nexpressly tells us not to do . . . . [Emphasis added; para. 40.] \\n[153] The court’s solution to this problem in Galindo Camayo was to reformulate \\nthe certified question to ask whether a particular  statutory inter pretation was \\nreasonable: \\nIn this case, the second and third questions, as stated, call for a correctness \\n \\nstatutory interpretation or approach suggested by the question is or is not \\nreasonable. [Emphasis added; para. 44.] \\n[154] This is also what the Federal Court did in Mr. Mason’s case, in an attempt \\nto incorporate reasonableness as the applicable standard of review: \\n The parties, however, each proposed their version of the question \\nreferring to the “correctness” of the IAD’s interpretation. I thus rephrase \\nthe question as follows, incorporating reasonableness as the applicable \\nstandard of review: \\n \\nIs it reasonable to interpret section 34(1)(e) of the Immigration and \\nRefugee Protection Act , S.C.  2001, c.  27, in a manner that does not \\nrequire proof of conduct that has a nexus with “national security” or “the \\nsecurity of Canada?” \\n \\n(2019 FC 1251, [2020] 2 F.C.R. 3, at para. 70) \\n[155] In my view, this clearly distorts Parliament’s intent in s.  74(d). I do not \\naccept that Parliament intended courts to reformulate certified questions, rather than \\nanswering them correctly. Where appellate courts conclude that there is only one \\nreasonable interpretation of a disputed statutory provision, I struggle to see any \\nmeaningful difference between that interpretation and the correct interpretation of the \\nstatutory provision in question. Where there may be multiple “reasonable” \\ninterpretations, appellate courts are faced with the prospect of upholding decisions that \\nincorrectly determine questions of law  — for example, the impact of Canada’s \\ninternational law obligations on the interpretation of certain sections of the IRPA (see \\n \\n[156] In this case, the IAD’s failure to consider this issue at all may have been \\nunreasonable (see Jamal J.’s reasons, at para. 117). But what if the IAD had considered \\nthe issue and reached a reasonable, though incorrect, conclusion? As Bastarache  J. \\nwarned in Pushpanathan, appellate courts applying reasonableness revi ew would be \\nforced to defer to that decision. In this case, it would result in the deportation of \\nMr. Mason and Mr.  Dleiow from Canada. In future cases, it could result in foreign \\nnationals being returned to countries where they may face persecution, in a manner \\ncontrary to Canada’s non-refoulement obligations (Jamal J.’s reasons, at paras. 104 and \\n109). \\n[157] In my view, this is untenable, and contrary to Parliament’s express intent \\nfor serious questions of general importance certified under s.  74(d) of the IRPA to be \\nreviewed and determined by appellate courts. \\n(2) The Rule of Law \\n[158] The presumption of reasonableness review must also give way to the \\nimportance of maintaining the rule of law, which requires that certified questions be \\nanswered consistently and definitively (see Society of Composers, at para. 33; Vavilov, \\nat para. 53). I say this for two reasons. \\n \\n[159] First, the rule of law demands a “singular, determinate and final answer” \\n(Vavilov, at para. 32) to a question certified as a serious question of general importance \\nunder the IRPA. In Lunyamila, the Federal Court of Appeal reiterated the criteria for \\ncertification under s. 74(d): \\nThe question must be a serious question that is dispositive of the appeal, \\ntranscends the interests of the parties and raises an issue of broad \\nsignificance or general importance. [Emphasis added; para. 46.] \\n(See also Canada (Immigration and Citizenship) v. Laing , 2021 FCA 194, at para.  11 \\n(CanLII); Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v. XY, 2022 FCA 113, \\n89 Imm. L.R. (4th) 173, at para. 7). \\n[160] A question whose answer turns on the unique facts of the case will not be \\ncertified (Lunyamila, at para. 46, citing Mudrak v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and \\nImmigration), 2016 FCA 178, 43 Imm. L.R. (4th) 199). By definition, then, certified \\nquestions concern issues of broad significance or general importance within Canada’s \\nimmigration and refugee protection regime. In my view, these are exactly the types of \\nquestions for which the rule of law demands consistent and definitive answers  — and \\nfor which the risk of arbitrariness is unacceptable. \\n[161] In Vavilov, our Court accepted that legal incoherence is antithetical to the \\nrule of law (para.  72). While the Court rejected “persistent discord within an \\n \\nthe ability of a “more robust” form of reasonableness to guard against the risk of \\narbitrariness: \\nWe are not persuaded that the Court should recognize a distinct \\ncorrectness category for legal questions on which there is persistent discord \\nwithin an administrative body. In Domtar Inc. v. Quebec (Commission \\nd’appel en matière de lésions professionnelles) , [1993] 2 S.C.R. 756, this \\nCourt held that “a lack of unanimity [within a tribunal] is the price to pay \\nfor the decision-making freedom and independence given to the members \\nof these tribunals”: p.  800; see also Ellis-Don Ltd. v. Ontario (Labour \\nRelations Board), 2001 SCC 4, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 221, at para. 28. That said, \\nwe agree that the hypothetical scenario suggested by the amici curiae — in \\nwhich the law’s meaning depends on the identity of the individual decision \\nmaker, thereby leading to legal incoherence — is antithetical to the rule of \\nlaw. In our view, however, the more robust form of reasonableness review \\nset out below, which accounts for the value of consistency and the threat \\nof arbitrariness, is capable, in tandem with internal administrative \\nprocesses to promote consistency and with legislative oversight  (see \\nDomtar, at p. 801), of guarding against threats to the rule of law. [Emphasis \\nadded; para. 72.] \\n[162] There are two issues with even a “robust” form of reasonableness review \\nin the context of certified questions. First, the “internal administrative processes” \\nreferenced in Vavilov, in this context, depend on appellate courts resolving \\ndisagreements on legal issues of general importance. As the Federal Court of Appeal \\nnoted in Huruglica, this process has been welcomed by the IAD and the Refugee \\nProtection Division (“RPD”): \\n. . . for many years, the Federal Court resor ted to the certification \\nprocess under paragraph  74(d) to settle divergent interpretations or \\ndisagreements on legal issues of general importance . This Court’s \\nproviding the correct answer to certified questions appears to have been \\nwelcomed, particularly by the IAD and the RPD, who saw it as helpful in \\n \\n[163] In other words, the certified question process is the very way in which \\ninternal disputes are resolved within this administrative scheme, for a speci fic subset \\nof legal questions. This category of questions may be defined with precision (see \\nSociety of Composers , at para.  39). As Paul Daly notes, “the unique features of \\n[Canada’s] immigration regime could allow for correctness review where questions \\nhave been certified without having unfortunate consequences in other areas of law” \\n(Certified Questions, References and Reasonableness:  Canada (Citizenship and \\nImmigration) v. Galindo Camayo, 2022 FCA 50 , April  8, 2022 (online)). In the \\nimmigration context, the certified question procedure is “tailor -made to achieve \\ncorrectness review on questions of law” (ibid.). \\n[164] Second, the risk of arbitrariness may be acceptable in the context of \\ndecisions regarding the extent of an income replacement indemnity during a temporary \\nplant closure (as in Domtar Inc. v. Quebec (Commission d’appel en matière de lésions \\nprofessionnelles), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 756) or alleged violations of a provincial collective \\nagreement (as in Ellis-Don Ltd. v. Ontario (Labour Relations Board ), 2001 SCC 4, \\n[2001] 1 S.C.R. 221) to use the two examples referred to in Vavilov (para. 72). It is not \\nacceptable when the identity of the individual decision maker is what determines who \\nis permitted to remain in Canada, as in these companion appeals, or in the  context of \\nother serious questions of general importance under the IRPA. \\n[165] A number of scholars and several interveners in these appeals emphasize \\n \\naffected individuals, and th e corresponding need for courts to provide correct and \\ndefinitive answers in this context (see, e.g., J. C. Y. Liew, “The Good, the Bad, and the \\nUgly: A Preliminary Assessment of Whether the Vavilov Framework Adequately \\nAddresses Concerns of Marginalized C ommunities in the Immigration Law Context” \\n(2020), 98 Can. Bar Rev. 398, at p.  425; G. Heckman and A.  Khoday, “Once More \\nunto the Breach: Confronting the Standard of Review (Again) and the Imperative of \\nCorrectness Review when Interpreting the Scope of Ref ugee Protection” (2019), 42 \\nDal. L.J. 49, at pp. 62-68 and 82; I.F., Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers, at \\nparas. 20-21; I.F., Canadian Council for Refugees, at paras. 14-20; I.F., United Nations \\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, at paras. 21-24). I agree with my colleague that the \\npotential consequences of a decision are relevant to the substance of reasonableness \\nreview (see para. 69). But those consequences are also relevant to the determination of \\nthe standard of review, and to the imperative of pro viding legally correct answers in \\ncertain circumstances. \\n[166] As Professors Heckman and Khoday note, where different decision makers \\nadopt different interpretations of the scope of refugee protection under the IRPA, one \\nclaimant may receive protection while ano ther presenting an identical claim may be \\nreturned to their country of origin to face persecution. Given the “momentous impact” \\nof these decisions, “the existence of divergent interpretations of these key provisions is \\narbitrary and antithetical to the rule of law, which demands that the inconsistencies be \\n \\n[167] Relatedly, correctness review serves to ease the burden on lay applicants, \\nmany of whom will be facing life -changing immigration consequences. The  \\nreasonableness of an administrative decision depends, in large part, on the evidence \\nbefore the decision maker and the submissions made by the parties ( Vavilov, at \\npara. 94; see Jamal J.’s reasons, at para. 61). Not all immigration or refugee applicants \\nwill have the resources or knowledge to make sophisticated contextual and interpretive \\narguments. In the context of certified questions, even a robust form of reasonableness \\nreview may be insufficient to guard against the risk, and the consequences, of \\narbitrariness (see Vavilov, at para. 192). \\n[168] While not all certified questions concern issues of admissibility or \\ndeportation, I am satisfied that the rule of law nonetheless demands consistent and \\ndefinitive answers to all questions that are properly certified. I am unable to tolerate the \\nrisk of arbitrariness in this context. \\n(b) Consequences for the Justice System as a Whole or Other Institutions of \\nGovernment \\n[169] Second, questions certified under s.  74(d) will, by definition, have \\nimplications beyond the immediate pa rties. In addition to their potential impacts on \\nCanada’s international obligations, they may have impacts on criminal law or on other \\n \\n[170] For example, the Citizenship Act  allows the Minister to commence an \\n“action”, i.e., in the Federal Court, to have a person declared “inadmissible on security \\ngrounds, on grounds of violating human or international rights or on grounds of \\norganized criminality” under s. 34, 35, or 37 of the IRPA: \\nInadmissibility \\n \\n10.5 (1) On the request of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency \\nPreparedness, the Minister shall  — in the originating document that \\ncommences an action under subsection 10.1(1) on the basis that the person \\nobtained, retained, renounced or resumed his or her citizenship by false \\nrepresentation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material \\ncircumstances, with respect to a fact described in section  34, 35 or 37 of \\nthe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act  other than a fact that is also \\ndescribed in paragraph 36(1)(a) or (b) or (2)(a) or (b) of that Act — seek a \\ndeclaration that the person who is the subject of the action is inadmissible \\non security grounds, on grounds of violating human or international rights \\nor on grounds of organized criminality under, respect ively, \\nsubsection 34(1), paragraph  35(1)(a) or (b) or subsection  37(1) of the  \\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act. \\n[171] The effect of s. 10.5(1) of the Citizenship Act is therefore to create a form \\nof shared jurisdiction between courts and administrative dec ision makers over \\ninadmissibility on grounds of security (s. 34), human or international rights violations \\n(s. 35), or organized criminality (s. 37). The implications of this were not argued by the \\nparties in these appeals, including in light of the new ca tegory of correctness review \\nrecognized by this Court in Society of Composers . However, it is clear that a \\ndetermination of inadmissibility under s.  34, 35, or 37  — as distinct from \\ninadmissibility on grounds of criminality (s. 36) or other less serious grounds set out in \\n \\nadequately safeguard against the need for consistency and legal coherence in this \\ncontext. \\n[172] Further, as this Court held in Vavilov, certain issues require a high deg ree \\nof interpretive consistency to ensure conformity with Canada’s international \\nobligations (para.  192). While neither Mr.  Mason nor Mr.  Dleiow is a Convention \\nrefugee, the IAD’s interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) could foreseeably impact Canada’s \\nfuture compl iance with its non-refoulement obligations (see Jamal  J.’s reasons, at \\nparas. 104-17). My colleague views the IAD’s “fail[ure] to address the legal constraints \\nimposed by international law” as unreasonable (para. 104). With respect, I would have \\nconcerns, given the emphasis in Vavilov on a “reasons first” approach, with finding a \\ndecision to be “unreasonable” based on arguments that were not put before the \\nadministrative decision maker and that do not apply to the individuals actually before \\nthat decision maker. Correctness review of certified questions eliminates such concerns \\nand ensures respect for Canada’s international and treaty obligations. \\n[173] The answers to certified questions under the IRPA may also have impacts \\non criminal law (see, e.g., Tran, at paras. 39-42). In such situations, a lack of clarity on \\nthe scope of inadmissibility under s.  34 may prevent accused persons from making \\ninformed decisions about whether to enter into a plea agreement. As Wagner  J. (as he \\nthen was) noted in R. v. Wong, 2018 SCC 25, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 696 (dissenting, but not \\n \\n[c]ollateral consequences that affect the accused person’s fundamental \\ninterests could have a more significant impact on the accused than the \\ncriminal sanction itself. As a result, it may be essential for an accused to \\nbe aware of such consequences in order to enter an informed guilty plea. \\nThis is particularly true in the immigration context, in which an accused \\nmay be exposed to a collateral consequence as serious as deportation. \\nPeople who are to be deported may experience any number of serious \\nlife-changing consequences. They may be forced to leave a country they \\nhave called home for decades. They may return to a country where they no \\nlonger have any personal connections, or even speak the language, if they \\nemigrated as children. If they have family in Canada, they and their family \\nmembers face dislocation or permanent separation. [para. 72] \\n[174] In sum, certified questions tend to have significant consequences for the \\njustice system as a whole or for other institutions of government (Vavilov, at para. 59). \\nIn many cases, this will arguably place them within the existing category of general \\nquestions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole. If not, the \\ncombined effect of their broader significance and Parliament’s intent that they be \\ndecided by appellate courts justifies a departure from the presumption of \\nreasonableness review. \\n[175] To be clear, this conclusion would not change the standard of review \\napplicable to the vast majority of administrative decisions under the IRPA. Decisions \\nof the Immigration and Refugee Board, as well as those made by various ministers, \\ngovernment departments, and agencies, would continue to be reviewed on a standard \\nof reasonableness in most cases. It is  only a small and distinct subset of legal \\nquestions — those certified as raising issues of broad significance or general \\nimportance within the statutory scheme  — for which the rule of law, in addition to \\n \\nIII. Application \\n[176] Applying a standard of review of correctness, I agree with my colleague \\nthat inadmissibility under s.  34(1)(e) requires a nexus between the relevant act of \\nviolence and with national security or the security of Canada (para. 121). Together with \\nthe reasons he identifies, I would briefly emphasize the following points of statutory \\ncontext. \\n[177] First, the government’s own explanation of the IRPA describes s. 34 as a \\n“national security” provision: \\nThis provision makes a person inadmissible to Canada for  reasons of \\nnational security , including espionage, subversion, and terrorism. This \\nprovision clearly states that permanent residents and foreign nationals are \\ninadmissible on security grounds for engaging in terrorism or for being a \\nmember of an organizat ion that engages in terrorism. The facts that \\nconstitute inadmissibility under this provision include facts arising from \\nomissions and those for which there are reasonable grounds to believe that \\nthey have occurred, are occurring or may occur. Other inadmi ssible \\ngrounds relating to security include being a danger to the security of \\nCanada and engaging in acts of violence that would or might endanger the \\nlives or safety of persons in Canada. [Emphasis added.] \\n \\n(Citizenship and Immigration Canada, Bill C-11: Clause by Clause \\nAnalysis (September 2001), at pp. 31-32) \\n[178] Second, the serious nature of inadmissibility on security grounds (see \\nJamal J.’s reasons, at paras.  86-97) is reinforced by several additional distinctions in \\nthe statutory scheme. Under s.  36(1), both foreign nationals and permanent residents \\n \\nmay be inadmissible on grounds of criminality (s.  36(2)). The difference between \\n“criminality” and “serious criminality”, for offences committed in Canada, is that \\nserious criminality requires a conviction for an offence punishable by a maximum term \\nof imprisonment of at least 10 years or for an offence for which a sentence of more than \\n6 months’ imprisonment has been imposed  (s. 36(1)(a)). A permanent resident \\nconvicted of an offence falling short of these requirements cannot be found \\ninadmissible under s. 36(2). \\n[179] The IAD’s interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) eliminates this carefully legislated \\ndistinction. A permanent resident who is charged with an act of violence that would not \\nqualify as serious criminality under s. 36(1) could instead be found inadmissible under \\ns. 34(1)(e), even if the alleged act did not result in a conviction. \\n[180] Further, s. 64(1) of the IRPA denies a right of appeal to permanent residents \\nor foreign nationals found inadmissible on grounds of security under s. 34, among other \\nserious categories of inadmissibility: \\nNo appeal for inadmissibility \\n \\n64 (1) No appeal may be made to the Immigration A ppeal Division by a \\nforeign national or their sponsor or by a permanent resident if the foreign \\nnational or permanent resident has been found to be inadmissible on \\ngrounds of security [(s.  34)], violating human or international rights \\n[(s. 35)], serious criminality [(s. 36(1))] or organized criminality [(s. 37)]. \\n[181] Thus, a foreign national convicted of assault, an act of violence, and found \\n \\ns. 36(2) may appeal that finding to the IAD. If the same conduct could ground \\ninadmissibility under s. 34(1)(e) — as the IAD held in this case — the foreign national \\nwould lose the ability to appeal. That person would be better off being convicted, and \\nfound inadmissible under s.  36(2), than if their charges were dropped or stayed and \\nthey were instead found inadmissible under s. 34(1)(e). \\n[182] Clearly, there is potential overlap between “acts of violence” contemplated \\nin s. 34(1)(e) and “criminality” addressed in s.  36. The implication of the respect ive \\ntreatment of these sections throughout the IRPA is that inadmissibility on security \\ngrounds, under s. 34, is more serious than inadmissibility on grounds of criminality. As \\nGrammond J. noted in Mr.  Mason’s case, the IAD’s interpretation of s.  34(1)(e) \\n“brings under the most severe category of inadmissibility a vast range of conduct that \\nincludes acts that are below the thresholds set by section  36” (F.C. reasons, Mason, at \\npara. 50). Given the careful wording of s.  36, this cannot have been Parliament’s  \\nintention. \\n[183] Third, I would return to s.  10.5(1) of the Citizenship Act , which also \\ndistinguishes between facts described in ss.  34, 35, and 37 of the IRPA and those \\ndescribed in s.  36. This, too, reinforces the fact that inadmissibility under s.  34 is \\nconsidered among the gravest forms of inadmissibility and that the section should be \\ninterpreted as applying only to acts of violence with a nexus to national security. \\n[184] This conclusion is consistent with the only prior interpretations of \\n \\nCanLII 146735 (I.R.B. (Imm.  Div.)), Member King held that a series of common \\nassaults could not ground inadmissibility under s. 34(1)(e): \\n I conclude that paragraph 34(1)(e) cannot be interpret ed to include the \\ntype of one -on-one violent acts that exist in this case. While assaults \\nagainst individuals are undesirable, they cannot be considered to be a threat \\nto the safety of persons in Canada and the security of Canadian society, as \\ncontemplated by this section of the IRPA. [para. 42] \\n[185] Member King also distinguished the circumstances in X (Re) from those \\nbefore the Federal Court in Moumdjian v. Canada (Security Intelligence Review \\nCommittee), [1999] 4 F.C. 624 (C.A.), which were “more obviously re lated to the \\nsecurity of Canada” and dealt with a conspiracy to assassinate a Turkish diplomat in \\nCanada (paras. 77-78; see also Al Yamani v. Canada (Solicitor General), [1996] 1 F.C. \\n174 (T.D.)). \\n[186] For these reasons, in addition to those identified by my co lleague and by \\nGrammond J. in the Federal Court, I would conclude that inadmissibility under \\ns. 34(1)(e) requires a nexus between the relevant act of violence and with national \\nsecurity or the security of Canada. However, it remains the task of administrat ive \\ndecision makers under the IRPA to apply this interpretation going forward, including \\ndetermining which acts of violence may indeed qualify as a threat to national security \\nor the security of Canada. \\n \\n[187] This Court has made it clear that the focu s of reasonableness review is on \\n“the decision the administrative decision maker actually made”, not on the conclusion \\nthe court would have reached in the decision maker’s place ( Vavilov, at para. 15; see \\nJamal J.’s reasons, at para. 8). Yet in the context of certified questions under the IRPA, \\nthis Court has repeatedly provided definitive, correct answers to disputed questions of \\nstatutory interpretation, including when applying a reasonableness standard of review. \\n[188] My colleague does so again in this case. While I agree that the IAD’s \\ninterpretation of s. 34(1)(e) was unreasonable, I do not accept that Parliament intended \\nfor courts to defer to reasonable but legally incorrect answers to this or other certified \\nquestions. Invariably, these questions transcen d the interests of the parties and raise \\nissues of broad significance and general importance within Canada’s immigration and \\nrefugee protection regime. These are the exact types of questions for which the rule of \\nlaw demands  — and Parliament expressly inte nded for appellate courts to \\nprovide — correct answers (see Vavilov, at paras.  10 and 69 -70). As required by the \\nprinciples and framework set out in Vavilov, I would recognize certified questions \\nunder the IRPA as a new category of correctness review moving forward. \\nV. Disposition \\n[189] In the result, I agree with my colleague’s disposition (para.  123). I would \\nallow the appeals, set aside the decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal and allow the \\n \\ndecision thus restoring the ID decision. In Mr.  Dleiow’s appeal, I would quash the ID \\ndecision and deportation order. \\n Appeals allowed. \\n Solicitors for the appellant  Earl Mason : Edelmann & Company Law \\nCorporation, Vancouver. \\n Solicitors for the appellant  Seifeslam Dleiow : Robert J.

Immigration \\nofficials reviewed C’s detention on a monthly basis, each time upholding the decision \\nthat he should be detained. After 13 months in detention, C filed an application for \\nhabeas corpus  on the gr ound that his detention was unlawful both because it had \\nbecome lengthy and indeterminate and because the conditions of his detention were \\ninappropriate, thus breaching his rights under ss. 7 and 9 of the Canadian Charter of \\nRights and Freedoms . The chambers judge declined jurisdiction to consider C’s \\napplication on the basis that the scheme set out in the Immigration and Refugee \\nProtection Act (“IRPA”) satisfied one of the two limited exceptions to the availability \\n \\nof habeas corpus, as the legislator had put in place a complete, comprehensive and \\nexpert statutory scheme which provides for a review at least as broad as that available \\nby way of habeas corpus and no less advantageous (the Peiroo exception). The Court \\nof Appeal allowed C’s appeal, hol ding that the exception did not apply and that the \\nchambers judge should have exercised his discretion to hear the application. \\n Held (Abella J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. \\n Per Wagner C.J. and Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Gascon, Côté and \\nBrown JJ.: The IRPA does not provide a review procedure that is at least as broad and \\nadvantageous as habeas corpus regarding the specific challenges to the legality of the \\ndetention raised by C’s habeas corpus  application. Accordingly, C was entitled to \\nhave his application heard by the chambers judge. \\n The writ of habeas corpus is an ancient legal remedy that remains \\nfundamental to liberty and the rule of law. Entrenched in s.  10(c) of the Charter, the \\nright to habeas corpus permits those in detention to go before a provincial superior \\ncourt and demand to know whether the detention is justified in law. A limited \\nexception to this right arises where the legislator has put in place a complete, \\ncomprehensive and expert statutory scheme which provides for a re view at least as \\nbroad as that available by way of habeas corpus and no less advantageous. However, \\nexceptions to the availability of habeas corpus must be interpreted restrictively. The \\ndetermination of whether a scheme is as broad and advantageous as habeas corpus \\nmust be considered with respect to the particular basis upon which the lawfulness of \\n \\nthe detention is challenged in the habeas corpus application. It is necessary to ask \\nupon what basis the legality of the detention is being challenged, and whether there is \\na complete, comprehensive and expert scheme that is as broad and advantageous as \\nhabeas corpus in relation to the specific grounds in the application. The scheme will \\nnot be as broad and a dvantageous as habeas corpus if it fails entirely to include the \\ngrounds set out in the application, or if it provides for review on the grounds in the \\napplication but the review process is not as broad and advantageous as that available \\nthrough habeas corpus, considering both the nature of the process and any advantages \\neach procedural vehicle may offer. \\n Applying this framework to C’s case reveals that the statutory scheme set \\nout in the IRPA is unable to effectively address the challenge raised by his application \\nin a manner that is as broad and advantageous as habeas corpus. The IRPA provides a \\ndetailed scheme to deal with the review of detention in the immigration context. Once \\nan initial detention order has been made, the IRPA review process provides f or \\nperiodic internal review of detention, for judicial review of those decisions by the \\nFederal Court, and for appeals to the Federal Court of Appe al. Immigration officials \\nare experts in applying their statutory mandates, and the Federal Court contributes  an \\nadditional layer of immigration -related expertise. The grounds for ordering or \\ncontinuing detention are clear. However, IRPA proceedings do not provide for review \\nas broad and advantageous as habeas corpus with respect to the specific basis upon \\nwhich C has challenged the legality of his detention  — that is, the length, uncertain \\nduration and conditions of his detention. Once the Minister has established grounds \\n \\nfor detention, immigration officers must consider factors which may weigh in favour \\nof release, which include: the reason for detention; the length of time in detention; \\nwhether detention is likely to continue and, if so, how long; any unexplained delays \\nor unexplained lack of diligence; alternatives to detention; and, the principles \\napplicable to s. 7 of the Charter. Although the length and likely duration of detention \\ncan be reviewed under the IRPA scheme, that review is not as broad and \\nadvantageous as that available through habeas corpus. The IRPA scheme falls short \\nin at least three important  ways: the onus in detention review is less advantageous to \\ndetainees than in habeas corpus  proceedings; the scope of immigration detention \\nreview before the federal courts is narrower than that of a superior court’s \\nconsideration of a habeas corpus application; and habeas corpus provides a more \\ntimely remedy than that afforded by judicial review. The IRPA scheme therefore fails \\nto provide relief that is as broad and advantageous as habeas corpus in response to \\nC’s challenge to the legality of the length and uncertain duration of his detention. \\n Per Abella J. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed. The superior \\ncourt properly declined to exercise its habeas corpus  jurisdiction in favour of the \\ncomplete, comprehensive and expert scheme to which C was entitled under the IRPA.  \\n There should be assertive and rigorous scrutiny of the lawfulness of any \\ndeprivation of liberty. That is why the IRPA should be interpreted i n a way that \\nguarantees the fullest possible range of scrutiny for detention, including the \\nconditions of detention. Nothing in the language of the IRPA precludes such a \\n \\ncomprehensive review. Rather, the basis for the entire scheme in the IRPA requires it. \\nExcluding the possibility of reviewing all aspects of immigration detention, including \\nits conditions and lawfulness, essentially and inappropriately reads out the detention \\nreview process in the IRPA and elevates habeas corpus  into the only meaningful \\nroute offering detainees a full review of their detention. The better approach is to \\ncontinue to read the language of the IRPA in a manner that is as broad and \\nadvantageous as habeas corpus  and that ensures the complete, comprehensive and \\nexpert review of im migration detention, as all of the Court’s previous jurisprudence \\nhas done.  \\n Habeas corpus  has historic roots which have spawned a variety of \\nstatutory remedies whose goal is to preserve the same protections. These can be found \\nin the IRPA. Their legitimacy as a genuine alternative to habeas corpus was judicially \\nconsidered and endorsed in Pringle v. Fraser , [1972] S.C.R. 821, Peiroo v. Canada \\n(Minister of Employment and Immigration)  (1989), 69 O.R. (2d) 253 , Reza v. \\nCanada, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 394, and May v. Ferndale, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 809. Each of \\nthese decisions emphasized that the habeas corpus -like remedies available in the \\nIRPA scheme are as broad as or broader than the traditional scope of review by way \\nof habeas corpus . The IRPA scheme was intended to pr ovide the same fulsome, \\nCharter-compliant review of immigration detention as habeas corpus . The Charter \\ninforms the interpretation of the IRPA in a manner that allows for the fullest possible \\nreview of a detainee’s loss of liberty. The IRPA must therefore be interpreted in a way \\nthat gives it the widest possible scope for implementing its objectives. The suggestion \\n \\nthat a full review of detention can only occur under habeas corpus departs from a \\nlongstanding jurisprudential consensus. There is no principled  reason to abandon the \\nsound logic in Pringle, Peiroo, Reza and May. The Court has consistently endorsed \\nthe exception limiting the availability of habeas corpus  review for immigration \\nmatters. Disturbing this jurisprudence will lead to forum shopping, inc onsistent \\ndecision-making, and multiplicity of proceedings.  \\n Nothing in the language of the statutory scheme restricts the scope of \\nIRPA detention review to a partial review which must be supplemented by habeas \\ncorpus. On the contrary, the IRPA scheme is structured to provide detainees with at \\nleast the same rights they would receive on habeas corpus  review. All detentions \\nmust be reviewed regularly, and review hearings are structured to be expeditious and \\naccessible. Immigration officers are responsible f or bringing the detainee before the \\nImmigration Division for all review hearings . The Immigration Division can require \\nthe parties to appear, and may order the continued detention of a detainee, their \\nunconditional release, or their release on conditions. A detainee may also apply for \\nleave and judicial review to the Federal Court. In addition, no onus is placed on the \\ndetainee, unlike in the case of habeas corpus applications. The IRPA scheme must be \\ninterpreted harmoniously with the Charter values that shape the contours of its \\napplication and the scheme must be applied in a manner that is at least as rigorous and \\nfair as habeas corpus  review. The Immigration Division must weigh the purposes \\nserved by immigration detention against the detain ed individual’s ss. 7, 9 and 12 \\n \\nCharter rights. That necessarily includes consideration of the conditions of detention, \\nand it ensures the protection of Charter rights. \\n Section 248 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations  \\nrequires the Immigration Division to consider factors to determine if detention should \\ncontinue. The factors ensure that extended periods of detention do not violate the \\nCharter. The Immigration Division must weigh the state’s immigration objectives \\nagainst the detained individual’s right to be free from arbitrary or indefinite restraints \\non liberty. A prior, fact -driven determination that the individual constitutes a flight \\nrisk or a danger to the public is entitled to deference . The justification for continued \\ndetention decreases as the length of time in detention increases, and the evidentiary \\nburden on the detaining authority increases as the length of detention increases. The \\nImmigration Division must consider conditions of and alternatives to detention, \\nincluding release.  Delays or lack of diligence on the part of the immigration \\nauthorities must be considered. The anticipated future length of detention must also \\nbe considered, which requires an estimation of how long detention is likely to \\ncontinue. The Immigration Divisi on is better positioned to assess and address this \\nfactor than the superior courts on habeas corpus. The process of review demands that \\nthe Immigration Division consider at least the same considerations that superior \\ncourts weigh on habeas corpus  review. P roperly interpreted, therefore, the IRPA \\nscheme provides for the fullest possible review of immigration detention, and, where \\ndetention is said to violate ss. 7, 9 and 12 of the Charter, the review process allows \\nfor at least the same substantive assessmen t as that undertaken by superior courts on \\n \\nhabeas corpus  review. Since the Court has repeatedly affirmed that habeas corpus  \\nwill not lie if the statutory alternative provides a remedy that is at least as favourable, \\nthe superior court properly declined to exercise its habeas corpus jurisdiction. \\nCases Cited \\nBy Karakatsanis J. \\n Distinguished: Peiroo v.

Overview \\n[1] The writ of habeas corpus is an ancient legal remedy that remains \\nfundamental to individual liberty and the rule of law today. Dating back to the 13th \\ncentury, this writ guarantees the individual’s protection from unlawful deprivations of \\nliberty. Entrenched in s. 10( c) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the \\nright to habeas corpus permits those in detention to go before a provincial superior \\ncourt and demand to know whether the detention is justified in law. If the r elevant \\nauthority cannot provide sufficient justification, the person must be released.  \\n \\n[2] Despite the importance of habeas corpus, this Court has carved out two \\nlimited exceptions to its availability. First, a provincial superior court should decline \\njurisdiction to entertain an application for habeas corpus where a prisoner is using the \\napplication to attack the legality of their conviction or sentence, as this is properly \\naccomplished through the ordinary appeal mechanisms set out in the Criminal Code, \\nR.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (see R. v. Gamble, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 595, at pp. 636 -37). Second, \\na provincial superior court should also decline jurisdiction where the legislator has \\nput in place “a complete, comprehensive and expert statutory scheme which provides \\nfor a review at least as broad as that available by way of habeas corpus and no less \\nadvantageous” (May v. Ferndale Institution , 2005 SCC 82, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 809, at \\npara. 40). This second exception has come to be known as the Peiroo exception (see \\nPeiroo v. Ca nada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)  (1989), 69 O.R. (2d) \\n253 (C.A.)).  \\n[3] In this case, Mr. Chhina applied for habeas corpus , arguing that his \\nimmigration detention had become unlawful under the Charter because of its length \\nand uncertain duration. He also challenged his detention on the basis that he was \\nbeing held in inappropriate lockdown conditions at a maximum security unit. \\n[4] This Court must determine whether the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench \\nerred in declining its jurisdiction to entertain Mr. Chhina’s application for habeas \\ncorpus on the basis that the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 \\n(IRPA) satisfies the second exception.  \\n \\n[5] The parties do not contest that the statutory scheme set out in the IRPA \\nprovides a complete, comp rehensive and expert procedure for the review of \\nimmigration matters generally. This was the conclusion reached by the Ontario Court \\nof Appeal in Peiroo. What this case emphasizes, however, is that the determination of \\nwhether such a scheme is as broad and  advantageous as habeas corpus  must be \\nconsidered with respect to the particular basis  upon which the lawfulness of the \\ndetention is challenged. \\n[6] Therefore, the Peiroo exception does not bar habeas corpus applications \\nwith respect to all deprivations of liberty arising from the immigration scheme. \\nRather the question here is whether the IRPA provides a review procedure that is at \\nleast as broad and advantageous as habeas corpus regarding the specific challenges to \\nthe legality of the detention raised by the habeas corpus application.  \\n[7] In my view, it does not. Mr. Chhina did not challenge his immigration \\nstatus, deportation order or detention order as failing to respect the IRPA. Rather, he \\nclaimed that his c ontinued detention had become unlawful because its length, \\nconditions and uncertain duration violated his Charter rights. The IRPA does not \\nprovide for review that is at least as broad and advantageous as habeas corpus  for \\nsuch matters. Mr. Chhina was ther efore entitled to have his application for habeas \\ncorpus heard by a judge of the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench. \\nII. Background \\n \\n[8] The respondent, Tusif Chhina,  entered Canada under another name in \\nDecember 2006 and obtained refugee status approximately two years  later. In \\nFebruary 2012, Mr. Chhina’s refugee status was vacated and he was declared \\ninadmissible to Canada due to both misrepresentations in his refugee application and \\nhis involvement in criminal activity. A deportation order was issued against him.  \\n[9] Following time spent in criminal custody, Mr. Chhina was taken into \\nimmigration detention in April 2013. However, in light of delays in obtaining travel \\ndocuments from Pakistan, Mr. Chhina was released with conditions seven months \\nlater. Mr. Chhina failed to  respect his conditions and disappeared for a year, but he \\nwas eventually taken back into immigration custody in November 2015. He was \\ndetained in the Calgary Remand Centre, a maximum security unit which keeps \\ninmates on lockdown 22 and a half hours a day.  Pursuant to s. 57 of the IRPA, \\nimmigration officials reviewed Mr. Chhina’s detention on a monthly basis, each time \\nupholding the decision that he should be detained. \\n[10] Mr. Chhina filed his habeas corpus application in May 2016, arguing that \\nhis immigration detention had become unlawful both because it had become lengthy \\nand indeterminate and because the conditions of his detention were “inappropriate” \\n(Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta Reasons, No. 16057 6914X1, September 2, 2016 \\n(unreported), at p. 2). At the time of his application before the Alberta Court of \\nQueen’s Bench, he had spent a total of 13 months in immigration detention.  \\n \\n[11] The chambers judge declined jurisdiction to consider Mr. Chhina’s \\napplication for habeas corpus , citing the IRPA as a comprehensive legislative \\nframework that would satisfy the Peiroo exception.  \\n[12] The Alberta Court of Appeal (2017 ABCA 248, 56 Alta. L.R. (6th) 1) \\nreversed that decision, holding that the chambers judge should h ave exercised his \\ndiscretion to hear Mr. Chhina’s habeas corpus application. Given the importance of \\nthe writ, the court noted that exceptions to the availability of habeas corpus must be \\nlimited and well -defined. As such, a chambers judge should decline t o hear habeas \\ncorpus applications only in limited circumstances, beyond which the decision to \\ndecline jurisdiction constitutes an error of law.  \\n[13] While acknowledging the holding in Peiroo, Greckol J.A., writing for the \\ncourt, concluded that the exception do es not bar habeas corpus  applications in all \\nimmigration-related matters. She distinguished Mr. Chhina’s challenge noting that, \\nunlike the applicant in Peiroo, Mr. Chhina did not contest determinations regarding \\nhis inadmissibility or deportation. Instead,  he challenged the legality of his detention, \\nincidental to those determinations, on Charter grounds. The outcome of Mr. Chhina’s \\nhabeas corpus application would have no effect on his immigration status or \\ndeportation order but, if successful, would affect his immediate liberty.  \\n[14] Through this lens, Greckol J.A. saw clear differences between the review \\nand relief available via the IRPA process as compared to an application for habeas \\ncorpus, finding the latter broader and more advantageous where the challeng e related \\n \\nto the length and indeterminate nature of the detention. As such, the Peiroo exception \\ndid not apply to Mr. Chhina’s case and the matter was remitted to the Court of \\nQueen’s Bench for a hearing on the merits of the habeas corpus application.  \\n[15] Travel documents were subsequently obtained for Mr. Chhina and he was \\nremoved from Canada in September 2017. Thus, the arguments regarding his \\ndetention are now moot. But a s Mr. Chhina’s case illustrates, habeas corpus \\napplications are often evasive of review , as the shifting factual circumstances \\nfrequently render the application moot before appellate review can be obtained \\n(Mission Institution v. Khela , 2014 SCC 24, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 502, at para. 14). Given \\nthe importance of clearly delineating the exceptions  to habeas corpus , it is \\nappropriate for this Court to consider the legal issues raised by Mr. Chhina’s appeal \\nnotwithstanding its mootness. No party has objected to this Court doing so. \\nIII. Issues \\n[16] This appeal concerns the scope and application of the Peiroo exception, \\nproviding the Court with an opportunity to clarify when a complete, comprehensive \\nand expert statutory scheme provides for review that is as broad and advantageous as \\nhabeas corpus such that an applicant will be precluded from bringing an applica tion \\nfor habeas corpus.1 \\n                                                 \\n1 Although Mr. Chhina sought to argue before this Court that the common law Peiroo exception \\nviolates s . 10(c) of the Charter and cannot be saved under s . 1, he failed to file a notice of \\n \\nIV. Analysis \\n[17] Provincial superior courts have inherent jurisdiction to hear habeas \\ncorpus applications (May, at para. 29). An application for habeas corpus requires the \\napplicant to establish a deprivation of liberty and to raise a legi timate ground for \\nquestioning the legality of that deprivation. If this is accomplished, the onus then \\nshifts to the authority in question to show that the deprivation of liberty is lawful. In \\norder for detention to be lawful, the decision -maker must have authority to order \\ndetention, the decision -making process must be fair, and the decision to detain must \\nbe both reasonable and compliant with the Charter (May, at para. 77; R. v. Khela , \\n2009 SCC 4, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 104, at para. 72). Changes in conditions o r orders \\nleading to further deprivations of liberty may also be challenged in the same manner. \\nWhere, as here, the application is brought with certiorari in aid, the court hearing the \\napplication conducts its review on the basis of the record that resulted  in the decision \\n(J. Farbey and R. J. Sharpe, with S. Atrill, The Law of Habeas Corpus (3rd ed. 2011), \\nat p. 45; Mission Institution v. Khela, at para. 35; R. v. Miller, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 613, at \\np. 624).  \\n[18] The writ of habeas corpus is not a discretionary remedy; it issues as of \\nright where the applicant successfully challenges the legality of a detention. A \\nprovincial superior court may not decline jurisdiction to hear such an application \\nmerely because alternative remedies are avai lable (May, at paras. 34 and 44). Such a \\n                                                                                                                                           \\nconstitutional question within the specified timeline. Accordingly, t hat argument is not before the \\nCourt in this appeal. \\n \\ncourt may only decline jurisdiction where the legislator has put in place “a complete, \\ncomprehensive and expert statutory scheme which provides for a review at least as \\nbroad as that available by way of habeas corpus and no less advantageous”  (May, at \\npara. 40; R. v. Bird , 2019 SCC 7, at para. 65).  As Mr. Chhina’s case illustrates, this \\nanalysis must be undertaken regarding the nature of the specific challenge to the \\nlegality of the detention raised in the habeas corpus application. \\n[19] Habeas corpus — which roughly translates to “produce the body” — was \\na familiar phrase in 13th century English civil procedure; it required the defendant of \\nan action to be brought physically before the court (Farbey, Sharpe and Atrill, at p. 2). \\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries, habeas corpus took on its modern form, \\npermitting an applicant to demand justification for their detention (at p. 4) and \\nbecoming the “great and efficacious writ in all manner of illegal confinement” (W. \\nBlackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England , Book III, by T. P. Gallanis, ed. \\n(2016), at 131). Habeas corpus has never been “a static, narrow, formalistic remedy”; \\nrather, over the centuries, it “has grown to achieve its grand purpose — the protection \\nof individuals against erosion of their right to be free from wrongful restraints upon \\ntheir liberty” (May, at para. 21, citing Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U.S. 236 (1962), at \\np. 243).  \\n[20] Habeas corpus  continues to hold a vital and distinguished place in \\nCanada’s moder n legal landscape. Before the advent of the Charter, s. 2 of the \\nCanadian Bill of Rights, S.C. 1960, c. 44, established that no law of Canada would be \\n \\nconstrued or applied so as to deprive a person of a determination on the validity of \\ntheir detention, and  provided for release where that detention was found to be \\nunlawful. In 1982, habeas corpus became a constitutional right entrenched in s. 10( c) \\nof the Charter:  \\n10. Everyone has the right on arrest or detention: \\n \\n. . .  \\n \\n(c) to have the validity of the de tention determined by way of habeas \\ncorpus and to be released if the detention is not lawful. \\n[21] The review of legality under habeas corpus is broad, often protecting and \\ninteracting with other Charter rights, including: the right to life, liberty and securit y \\nof the person, as guaranteed by s. 7; the right not to be arbitrarily detained or \\nimprisoned, as guaranteed by s. 9; and the right not to be subjected to any cruel and \\nunusual treatment or punishment, as guaranteed by s. 12.  \\n[22] The case of Dumas v. Leclerc  Institute, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 459, helpfully \\nillustrates different circumstances in which a deprivation of liberty may arise, and \\nthus, different ways in which a detention may be challenged. A deprivation of liberty \\nmay relate to (1) the initial decision requiring the detention; or to a further deprivation \\nof liberty based on (2) a change in the conditions of the detention; or (3) the \\ncontinuation of the detention.  \\n \\n[23] While not exhaustive, this list may be particularly helpful in pinpointing \\nthe nature of a cha llenge to a deprivation of liberty for reasons beyond those \\nunderlying an initial order. As I shall explore in more detail below, these three \\ncategories can assist in explaining the relevant case -law. For example, in the \\nimmigration context, a finding of i nadmissibility may lead to a detention order that \\nconstitutes an initial deprivation of liberty: this is the first Dumas category (Peiroo). \\nThe transfer of prisoners from a lower to a higher security institution is emblematic of \\nthe second type of deprivat ion: a change in circumstances resulting in an additional \\ndeprivation of liberty ( May). The third type of deprivation outlined in Dumas can \\nspeak to extended detentions or detentions of uncertain duration, which may engage \\nss. 7 and 9 of the Charter, as was argued here (and in Chaudhary v. Canada (Minister \\nof Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2015 ONCA 700, 127 O.R. (3d) 401; \\nand Ogiamien v. Ontario (Community Safety and Correctional Services) , 2017 \\nONCA 839, 55 Imm. L.R. (4th) 220).  \\n[24] Regardless of how a deprivation of liberty arises, the importance of the \\n“great writ of liberty” underlies the general rule that exceptions to the availability of \\nhabeas corpus must be limited and carefully defined.  \\n[25] To date, this Court has recognized only two instances where a provincial \\nsuperior court may decline to hear a habeas corpus application. The first allows a \\nprovincial superior court to decline jurisdiction where a prisoner seeks to attack the \\nlegality of t heir conviction or sentence, determinations properly challenged through \\n \\nthe appeal mechanisms set out in the Criminal Code (Gamble, at p. 636). The second \\nexception arose in the field of immigration law. In Peiroo, the applicant sought \\nissuance of a writ o f habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, contesting a finding that \\nthere was no credible basis for her refugee claim and arguing that there was therefore \\nno basis for a removal order issued against her. The Ontario Court of Appeal found \\nthat the Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I -2, then in force established a \\ncomprehensive scheme regulating the determination and review of immigration \\nclaims in a manner that  was “as broad as or broader than the traditional scope of \\nreview by way of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid” (Peiroo, at p. 261). \\n[26] Both of these exceptions acknowledge the development of sophisticated \\nprocedural vehicles in our modern legal system and their ability to fully protect \\nfundamental rights such as habeas corpus.  \\n[27] Statutory appeals in crimina l matters, previously circumscribed by the \\ncommon law writs of certiorari and error, were introduced some 500 years after \\nhabeas corpus  (V. M. Del Buono, “The Right to Appeal in Indictable Cases; A \\nLegislative History” (1978), 16 Alta. L.R.  446, at p. 448) . Although the Court \\naffirmed the Criminal Code  exception in the context of a Charter challenge in \\nGamble, the rule pre -empting habeas corpus applications where a statutory appeal is \\navailable long pre-dates the Charter (see: In Re Trepanier  (1885), 12 S.C .R. 111; In \\nRe Sproule (1886), 12 S.C.R. 140, at p. 204; Goldhar v. The Queen , [1960] S.C.R. \\n \\n431, at p. 439; Morrison v. The Queen , [1966] S.C.R. 356; Karchesky v. The Queen , \\n[1967] S.C.R. 547, at p. 551; Korponay v. Kulik, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 265).  \\n[28] The IRPA, for its part,  is a product of the rise of the modern \\nadministrative state: a parallel justice system established alongside the courts of law \\nto provide accessible, expert, and expeditious adjudication of a broad spectrum of \\nclaims. For example, the decisi on in Pringle v. Fraser , [1972] S.C.R. 821, holding \\nthat the Immigration Act , R.S.C. 1952, c. 325, ousted provincial superior court \\njurisdiction to entertain a writ of certiorari, was an early recognition of the possibility \\nthat a legislature could create alternative avenues of review through administrative \\nbodies.  \\n[29] Both of these exceptions target similar concerns, primarily the “need to \\nrestrict the growth of collateral methods of attacking convictions or other deprivations \\nof liberty” ( May, at para. 35) . By affirming such statutory schemes, the standard set \\nout in May ensures the constitutional right to habeas corpus is protected, while also \\nrealizing judicial economy, avoiding d uplicative proceedings, and reducing the \\npossibility of inconsistent decisions and forum shopping. \\n[30] At issue in this appeal is the scope of the Peiroo exception and, more \\nspecifically, whether that exception precludes habeas corpus for all determinations \\nmade under immigration legislation. The appellant argues that it does, pointing to this \\nCourt’s description of the Peiroo exception in May, where we stated: “in matters of \\nimmigration law, because Parliament has put in place a complete, comprehensive and \\n \\nexpert statutory scheme which provides for a review at least as broad as that available \\nby way of habeas corpus  and no less advantageous, habeas corpus  is precluded” \\n(May, at para. 40). \\n[31] In my view, this statement was never intended to preclude habeas corpus \\nreview of every detention arising in the immigration context, whatever the nature of \\nthe challenge to the legality of the detention. I do not see May as standing for such a \\nbroad proposition. I say this for three reasons. \\n[32] First, the IRPA was not before the Court in May. In that case, a number of \\nfederal prisoners who were transferred from minimum to medium -security \\ninstitutions brought habeas corpus applications to challenge this transfer to a more \\nrestrictive form of custody. The warden of the institution a rgued that the Corrections \\nand Conditional Release Act , S.C. 1992, c. 20 ( CCRA), set out a comprehensive \\nstatutory scheme that provided effective remedies comparable to habeas corpus — a \\nproposition this Court did not accept. In that context, the Court com pared the CCRA \\nnot to the IRPA (although it was then in force), but rather to the Immigration Act  \\nconsidered in Peiroo. The Court concluded that, unlike the immigration scheme, the \\ncorrections statute did not guarantee impartial review, articulate specific and effective \\nremedies, or even provide clear grounds upon which transfer decisions could be \\nreviewed (May, at para. 62). \\n[33] Second, the jurisprudence relied on by the Court in May — Peiroo, \\nPringle, and Reza v. Canada , [1994] 2 S.C.R. 394, — did not stand for the broad \\n \\nproposition that habeas corpus will never be available where the detention is related \\nto immigration matters. May must be understood in light of the cases cited; the Court \\ndid not purport to extend their  holdings. Neither Pringle nor Reza dealt specifically \\nwith habeas corpus . Pringle was concerned with certiorari, a writ which, unlike \\nhabeas corpus, is not constitutionally protected.  Reza did not involve an application \\nfor habeas corpus, but a challenge to the constitutionality of the Immigration Act on \\nother grounds. Even Peiroo did not provide that habeas corpus could never lie in the \\nimmigration context. It simply determined that the Immigration Act then in force was \\n“as broad as or broader” than habeas corpus  for “immigration matters” like Ms. \\nPeiroo’s claim. Ms. Peiroo had argued that the adjudicator erred in finding she had no \\ncredible basis for her refugee claim and that her detention was therefore ordered \\nillegally.  \\n[34] Finally, May itself urges us to  interpret exceptions to the availability of \\nhabeas corpus restrictively: \\nGiven the historical importance of habeas corpus in the protection \\nof various liberty interests, jurisprudential developments limiting habeas \\ncorpus jurisdiction should be carefully evaluated and should not be \\nallowed to expand unchecked. The exceptions to habeas corpus  \\njurisdiction and the circumstances under which a superior court may \\ndecline jurisdiction should be well defined and limited.  \\n \\n(para. 50) \\n \\n[35] For these reasons, I do not t hink May should be interpreted as holding \\nthat the Peiroo exception bars all habeas corpus applications that arise in the \\nimmigration context, regardless of the grounds raised to challenge detention.  \\n[36] Two recent Ontario Court of Appeal cases — Chaudhary and Ogiamien \\n— recognized that the Peiroo exception does not bar all habeas corpus applications \\ntargeting a deprivation of liberty that arises from the immigration scheme. \\n[37] In Chaudhary, Rouleau J.A., writing for the court, distinguished the case \\nbefore him from Peiroo by noting that the applicant in Peiroo had challenged aspects \\nof her refugee status itself — an immigration determination for which the IRPA \\nprovided review as broad as habeas corpus — whereas the multiple applicants in \\nChaudhary challenged their detentions on the grounds that the extended duration or \\nindeterminacy of detention offended s. 7 of the Charter. The Court of Appeal \\nconcluded that the IRPA was not as broad or advantageous as habeas corpus  with \\nrespect to such queries. Moreover, the app licants challenged only their detention: the \\noutcome of the applications would have no effect on their immigration status. \\nUltimately, provincial superior court jurisdiction was a necessary complement to the \\nstatutory scheme in order to protect the constitutional right to habeas corpus.  \\n[38] Sharpe J.A. addressed similar facts in Ogiamien, finding that a 25 -month \\ndetention — on the basis of an outstanding deportation order — was subject to \\nhabeas corpus  review. Although the court found it was unnecessary to consider \\nMr. Ogiamien’s contention that he should have been detained in an immigration \\n \\nholding centre rather than in a maximum security facility — given that specific \\ncomplaint had been dealt with in a separat e application — it noted that the principle \\napplied in Chaudhary was not restricted to situations involving lengthy detentions of \\nuncertain duration. Instead, the principle rested upon the Superior Court’s broad \\nresidual jurisdiction to entertain habeas co rpus applications subject only to the \\nframework set out in May (Ogiamien, at paras. 38-42). \\n[39] I agree with the Chaudhary and Ogiamien approach, adopted by the \\nCourt of Appeal in this case. This approach properly flows from the principles set out \\nby this Court in May.  \\n[40] In sum, the Peiroo exception can be more clearly articulated as follows: \\nan application for habeas corpus will be precluded only when a complete, \\ncomprehensive and expert scheme provides for review that is at least as broad and \\nadvantageous as habeas corpus  with respect to the challenges raised by the habeas \\ncorpus application. An administrative scheme may be sufficient to safeguard the \\ninterests protected by habeas corpus  with respect to some types of challenges, but \\nmay also need to be re-examined with respect to others. It is thus essential to consider \\nhow the challenge to the unlawful detention is framed in the habeas corpus  \\napplication.  \\nA. Determining When the Exception Applies \\n \\n[41] How, then, does a court determine whether there is “a complete, \\ncomprehensive and expert statutory scheme which provides for a review at least as \\nbroad as that available by way of habeas corpus and no less advantageous” such that \\nan applicant will be precluded from bringing an application for habeas corpus (May, \\nat para. 40)?  \\n[42] First, it is necessary to ask upon what basis the legality of the detention is \\nbeing challenged. In other words, what are the grounds in the applicant’s habeas \\ncorpus application? Reference to the categories in Dumas may be helpful to this \\ninquiry. Is the applicant challenging an initial decision that resulted in detention, such \\nas a removal order? Are they challenging the conditions of their detention? Or are \\nthey challenging the length and uncertain duration of their detention? Precisely \\ndelineating the grounds for the habeas corpus application is necessary in order to \\ndetermine whether there is an effective statutory remedy to address those grounds. \\n[43] Second, it is necessary to ask whether there is a complete, comprehensive \\nand expert scheme that is a s broad and advantageous as habeas corpus in relation to \\nthe specific grounds in the habeas corpus application. Elements of the IRPA detention \\nreview scheme may speak to whether the scheme is complete, comprehensive and \\nexpert. However, the main issue in t his case, and the focus of the parties’ \\nsubmissions, is whether IRPA review is as broad and advantageous as habeas corpus \\nwith respect to the specific basis upon which Mr. Chhina challenged the legality of \\nhis detention. In this inquiry, it may be helpful to look at whether a statutory scheme \\n \\nfails entirely to include the grounds set out in the application for habeas corpus. If so, \\nthe scheme will not be as broad and advantageous as habeas corpus. The scheme will \\nalso fail to oust habeas corpus if it provid es for review on the grounds in the \\napplication, but the review process is not as broad and advantageous as that available \\nthrough habeas corpus, considering both the nature of the process and any advantages \\neach procedural vehicle may offer. \\n[44] As I shall ex plain, applying this framework to the facts of Mr. Chhina’s \\ncase reveals that while the statutory scheme set out in the IRPA, including judicial \\nreview, may provide adequate review with respect to some matters, it is unable to \\neffectively address the chall enge raised by Mr.  Chhina’s application in a manner that \\nis as broad and advantageous as habeas corpus.  \\nB. Identifying the Grounds of Mr. Chhina’s Challenge \\n[45] The first step is to identify the grounds raised in the habeas corpus \\napplication. Mr. Chhina challen ged the legality of his detention on two grounds: that \\nhe was being held in inappropriate conditions and that the duration of his detention \\nhad become indeterminate and overly lengthy. Mr. Chhina argued that the length and \\nduration of his detention violate d his rights under ss. 7 and 9 of the Charter because \\nthere was no reasonable prospect that the immigration -related purposes justifying his \\ndetention would be achieved within a reasonable time. The courts below proceeded \\non the basis of this second ground:  that the lengthy detention of indeterminate \\nduration violated the Charter. \\n \\n[46] Unlike in Peiroo, Mr. Chhina’s application for habeas corpus had \\nnothing to do with whether his inadmissibility or deportation were rightly or wrongly \\ndecided. \\nC. The IRPA Statutory Review Scheme \\n[47] In determining whether the scheme provides for review as broad and \\nadvantageous as habeas corpus , the court should look at the actual alternatives for \\ndetention review realistically available to someone in Mr. Chhina’s circumstances. As \\nthis Court stated in May, a “purposive approach . . . requires that we look at the entire \\ncontext”, which in that case included the relative disadvantages of judicial review in \\nthe Federal Court ( May, at para. 65). This examination may include any \\nadministrative adjudicators, tribunals, and internal appeal mechanisms, as well as \\navailable judicial review or statutory appeal routes. In this case, I consider both the \\nImmigration Division and the judicial review processes in the Federal Courts. \\n[48] I begin first with a  general overview of how the IRPA scheme functions \\nbefore considering whether it offers review as broad and advantageous as habeas \\ncorpus. The IRPA provides a detailed scheme to deal with the review of detention in \\nthe immigration context. Just as in the criminal context, a deprivation of liberty \\nordered pursuant to the IRPA must always be justified. Release is the default except \\nwhere the Minister e stablishes that: the detainee is a danger to the public or is \\nunlikely to appear at a hearing; the Minister is inquiring as to inadmissibility due to \\nsecurity risks, human rights violations or criminality; or the Minister has concerns \\n \\nabout establishing th e person’s identity ( IRPA, s. 58(1)). Each of these grounds of \\ndetention is determined in accordance with a list of immigration -specific factors set \\nout in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations , SOR/2002-227, ss. 244-\\n49 (IRPR).   \\n[49] Once an initi al detention order has been made, the IRPA review process \\nprovides for periodic internal review of detention by members of the Immigration \\nDivision of the Immigration and Refugee Board, who are appointed in accordance \\nwith the Public Service Employment Act , S.C. 2003, c. 22, ( IRPA, ss. 151 and \\n172(2)). A member of the Immigration Division must conduct an initial review within \\n48 hours of an individual being taken into immigration custody, as well as a review \\nwithin the 7 following days, and additional reviews every 30 days thereafter (IRPA, s. \\n57). \\n[50] The IRPA also explicitly provides for judicial review of those decisions \\nby the Federal Court (IRPA, s. 72). An appeal from this judicial review is available to \\nthe Federal Court of Appeal on a certified question of general importance ( IRPA, s. \\n74(d)). All the review processes are intimately linked, as judicial review is \\ncircumscribed by the statutory mandate of the original decision-maker.  \\n[51] Lastly, it should be noted that immigration officials are experts in \\napplying their statutory mandate. Given its role in judicial review, the Federal Court \\nhas also developed significant familiarity with the immigration context and \\ncontributes an additional layer of immigration-related expertise. \\n \\n[52] As this examination reveals, the  review process set out in the IRPA is \\ndetailed and clear. The grounds for ordering or continuing detention are clear. \\nIndependent review is assured by judicial review through the Federal Courts. Clear \\nremedies, namely release, exist.  \\n[53] However, as I shall explain, IRPA proceedings do not provide for review \\nas broad and advantageous as habeas corpus with respect to the specific basis upon \\nwhich Mr. Chhina has challenged the legality of his detention. \\nD. Is Review Under the IRPA as Broad and Advantageous as Habeas Corpus? \\n[54] The scope of review under the IRPA must, of course, actually include the \\ngrounds Mr. Chhina has raised. \\n[55] Once the Minister has established grounds for detention, immigration \\nofficers and members of the Immigration Division must consider factors w hich may \\nweigh in favour of release, set out at s. 248 of the IRPR:  \\n(a)  the reason for detention;  \\n(b) the length of time in detention;  \\n(c)  whether . . . that detention is likely to continue and, if so, [how \\nlong];  \\n(d) any unexplained delays or unexplained lack of diligence caused \\nby the Department, the Canada Border Services Agency, or the \\nperson concerned; and  \\n(e)  the existence of alternatives to detention.  \\n \\n[56] To this list, the Federal Court of Appeal has added that the decision -\\nmaker must be mindful  of the principles applicable to s. 7 of the Charter (Canada \\n(Minister of Citizenship & Immigration) v. Thanabalasingham , 2004 FCA 4, [2004] \\nF.C.R. 572, at para. 14).  \\n[57] Mr. Chhina challenged the length, uncertain duration and conditions of \\nhis detention. Th e conditions in which a person is detained are notably absent from \\nthe language of s. 248 of the  IRPR. Counsel for the appellant conceded as much, \\nadding that the conditions of detention are properly within the ambit of the provincial \\ncorrectional authorities or the Canadian Border Services Agency, not the Immigration \\nDivision (Brown v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) , 2017 FC 710, 25 Admin. \\nL.R. (6th) 191,  at para. 138). The Immigration Division has no explicit power to \\nexamine harsh or illegal condit ions. This is to be contrasted with habeas corpus , \\nwhich provides for review of any unlawful form of detention. The inability of a \\nscheme to respond to the specific ground raised in an application of habeas corpus \\nwould mean that the scheme does not preclu de habeas corpus. However, this ground \\nof Mr. Chhina’s habeas corpus application was not addressed by the Court of Appeal, \\nnor was it argued before this Court.  \\n[58] In contrast to the absence of conditions, the regulations do provide for \\nconsideration of the length and likely duration of detention ( IRPR, s. 248(c) and (d)). \\nThe question thus becomes whether review of the length and duration of detention \\nunder the IRPA is as broad and advantageous as that available through habeas corpus. \\n \\nThis requires considerat ion of the nature of the review process and any advantages \\nprovided by each procedural vehicle.  \\n[59] I conclude that the IRPA does not provide for review as broad and \\nadvantageous as habeas corpus where the applicant alleges their immigration \\ndetention is unlawful on the grounds that it is lengthy and of uncertain duration. \\nTaken as a whole, the scheme falls short in at least three important ways. First, the \\nonus in detention review under the IRPA is less advantageous to detainees than in \\nhabeas corpus proceedings. Second, the scope of review before the Federal Courts is \\nnarrower than that of a provincial superior court’s consideration of a habeas corpus \\napplication. Third, habeas corpus provides a m ore timely remedy than that afforded \\nby judicial review. \\n[60] Under the IRPA, the Minister need only make out a prima facie case for \\ncontinued detention (e.g., indicate that the detainee is a continued flight risk) in order \\nto shift the onus to the detainee to justify release. While the IRPA places the onus on \\nthe Minister to demonstrate a ground for detention ( IRPA, s. 58), the regulations \\nsimply state that the length and likely duration of detention (among other factors) \\n“shall be considered before a decision is made on detention or release” ( IRPR, s. \\n248). The Federal Court has interpreted the regulations as imposing the onus on the \\ndetainees to demonstrate that their continued detention would be unlawful in light of \\nthe s. 248 factors ( Thanabalasingham, at pa ra. 16; Chaudhary, at para. 86; Canada \\n(Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v. Lunyamila , 2016 FC 1199, [2017] 3 \\n \\nF.C.R. 428). This understanding of who bears the onus is consistent with the general \\nprinciple that a Charter applicant bears the onus of  establishing a Charter \\ninfringement. In addition, while s. 248 provides that an Immigration Division member \\nmust consider certain factors, the regulations provide no guidance as to how the \\nlength and duration of detention are to be considered and, crucial ly, when these \\nfactors might be outweighed by others — such as the reason for detention.  Thus, as \\nRouleau J.A. has correctly observed, the IRPA does not require the Minister to \\nexplain or justify the length and uncertain duration of a detention, because th e \\nMinister need only establish one of the grounds at s. 58 of the scheme in order to shift \\nthe onus to the detainee ( Chaudhary, at para. 86). This contrasts sharply with habeas \\ncorpus where, subject to raising a legitimate ground, the onus is on the Minist er to \\njustify the legality of the detention in any respect. As noted by this Court in Mission \\nInstitution v. Khela, the onus in habeas corpus is of particular historical significance:  \\nThis particular shift in onus is unique to the writ of  habeas corpus. Shifting \\nthe legal burden on the detaining authorities is compatible with the very \\nfoundation of the law of habeas corpus, namely that a deprivation of liberty is \\npermissible only if the party effecting the deprivation can demonstrate that it \\nis justified. \\n  \\n(para. 40) \\n[61] Further, on judicial review to the Federal Court, the onus lies squarely \\nupon the applicant to establish that the decision is unreasonable (Mission Institution v. \\nKhela, at para. 40). \\n \\n[62] Moreover, under the IRPA the Minister may satisfy its onus by relying on \\nreasons given at a prior detention hearing. This practice has been encouraged by the \\nFederal Courts, which have held that, while previous detention decisions are not \\nbinding, “if a member chooses to depart from prior decisions to detain, clea r and \\ncompelling reasons for doing so must be set out” (Thanabalasingham, at para. 10; see \\nalso, among others: Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v. \\nMehmedovic, 2018 FC 729, at para. 19 (CanLII); Canada (Public Safety and \\nEmergency Preparedn ess) v. Torres , 2017 FC 918, at para. 20 (CanLII); Canada \\n(Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v. Karimi -Arshad, 2010 FC \\n964, 373 F.T.R. 292, at para. 16). In other words, immigration officials may rely \\nentirely on reasons given by previo us officials to order continued detention and \\nremain fully compliant with the IRPA scheme. In practice, the periodic reviews \\nmandated by the IRPA are susceptible to self -referential reasoning, instead of \\nconstituting a fresh and independent look at a detainee’s circumstances. \\n[63] Thus, the scheme fails to provide the detainee with the fresh and focussed \\nreview provided by habeas corpus , where the Minister bears the onus. The fresh \\nevidence filed before this Court emphasizes the above points. An external au dit \\ncommissioned by the chair of the Immigration and Refugee Board offers a timely, \\nand frankly unfortunate, picture of how the scheme is being administered for those in \\nlong-term detention. The 2018 audit highlights how, in practice, detainees do not \\nreceive the full benefit of the scheme:  \\n \\n- in principle, the Immigration Division should place the onus on the \\nMinister to continue detention; in practice they often fail to do so \\n(2017/2018, Audit, at p. 18); \\n \\n- in principle, the Immigration Division should be ap proaching each \\ndetention review afresh; in practice, the Immigration Division is overly \\nreliant on past detention review decisions (2017/2018, Audit, pp. 31-32); \\n \\n- in principle, the Immigration Division should be impartial and \\nindependent from the Canadian Border Services Agency; in practice, the \\nImmigration Division often overly relies on the Canada Border Services \\nAgency’s submissions (2017/2018, Audit, pp. 17-18); and \\n \\n- in principle, the Immigration Division should be reviewing IRPA \\ndetentions for complian ce with ss. 7, 9, and 12 of the Charter; in \\npractice, as a result of their failure to consider each detention review \\nafresh, they do not do so (2017/2018, Audit, pp. 31-32). \\n[64] The second disadvantage of the IRPA scheme is the scope of review. As a \\npractical matter, the Immigration Division does not conduct a fresh review of each \\nperiodic detention, as discussed above; as such, the scope of review before the \\nFederal Courts is correspondingly narrower than review on habeas corpus. The broad \\nreview provided by habeas corpus grapples with detention as a whole. This case, for \\n \\nexample, required a holistic consideration of Mr. Chhina’s Charter rights and how \\nthey may have been violated — not by an individual decision but by the overall \\ncontext of his detention. This type of inquiry is closely tied to the expertise of the \\nprovincial superior courts ( May, at para. 68; see also Mission Institution v. Khela , at \\npara. 45; Chaudhary, at para. 102).  Relief through judicial review on the other hand, \\nmay be sought only with re spect to a single decision, which in the  IRPA context is \\ngenerally the most recent 30-day review (Federal Courts Rules, SOR/98-106, s. 302).  \\n[65] Further, the remedies available on judicial review are more limited and \\nless advantageous to a detainee than on habeas corpus. Although the Federal Courts \\ndo have limited powers of mandamus — the power to require a decision -maker to \\ntake positive action, such as requiring the Immigration Division to release a detainee \\n— I am aware of no cases in which release has been  ordered. To the extent that they \\ncan exercise this power, the remedy is granted only where “certain relatively rarely \\noccurring prerequisites are met”  (Fisher-Tennant v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship \\nand Immigration), 2018 FCA 132, at para. 28 (CanLII)). Instead, a successful judicial \\nreview will generally result in an order for redetermination, requiring further hearings \\nto obtain release and thereby extending detention. This is to be contrasted with \\nhabeas corpus, where release is ordered immediately o nce the relevant authority has \\nfailed to justify the deprivation of liberty. \\n[66] Lastly, habeas corpus provides a more timely remedy than those \\navailable through the IRPA. L eave is required for judicial review of a detention \\n \\ndecision made under the IRPA, and p erfecting an application for leave on judicial \\nreview can take up to 85 days ( IRPA, s. 72(2)(b); Federal Courts Citizenship, \\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Rules , SOR/93-22, rr. 10(1), 11 and 13). As the \\nFederal Court has acknowledged, even in the best  of circumstances, it is thus \\nimpracticable for judicial review to occur before the next 30-day detention review has \\nbeen held, rendering the outcome of the judicial review moot ( Canada (Citizenship \\nand Immigration) v. B386 , 2011 FC 175, [2012] 4 F.C.R. 22 0, at para. 13; \\nChaudhary, at para. 94). The remedy of a rehearing restarts the review process, \\nleading to further delays. This cycle of mootness at the judicial review stage acts as a \\nbarrier to timely and effective relief.  \\n[67] In contrast, the importance of  habeas corpus as a “swift and imperative \\nremedy” has long been recognized ( Mission Institution v. Khela , at para. 3; In Re \\nStorgoff, [1945] S.C.R. 526, at p. 591). Courts across the country have acknowledged \\nthis by enacting rules that prioritize the hear ing of habeas corpus  applications. \\nHabeas corpus writs are “returnable immediately” before a superior court judge in \\nOntario, and the hearing of habeas corpus applications have priority over other \\nbusiness of the court in both Quebec and Nova Scotia ( Habeas Corpus Act , R.S.O. \\n1990, c. H.1, s. 1(1); Code of Civil Procedure , CQLR, c. C -25.01, art. 82 para. 3; \\nNova Scotia Civil Procedure Rules , Royal Gaz. Nov. 19, 2008, r. 7.13(1); see also \\nCriminal Procedure Rules of the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories, Canada \\nGazette, Part II, vol. 132, No. 10, May 13, 1998, SI/98 -78, ss. 103 to 107). The \\nadvantages habeas corpus offers with respect to timeliness are especially relevant to \\n \\nan application like Mr. Chhina’s, which was primarily concerned with the dur ation of \\nhis detention. \\n[68] In sum, the IRPA fails to provide relief that is as broad and advantageous \\nas habeas corpus in response to Mr. Chhina’s challenge to the legality of the length \\nand uncertain duration of his detention. \\nV. Motion to Vary the Record \\n[69] On appeal before this Court, the respondent brought a motion to vary the \\nrecord and file new evidence. This new evidence included a troubling audit that found \\nexamples of maladministration within the IRPA scheme, resulting in some detainees \\nbeing kept in a cycle of long-term detention.  \\n[70] While the evidence was not necessary to resolve this appeal, it is \\nadmissible pursuant to Palmer v. The Queen , [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, at p. 775. The \\nevidence is new, relevant, credible and confirmatory in that it provides stat istical \\nevidence supporting the argument that the IRPA scheme is not as broad and \\nadvantageous as habeas corpus for lengthy detentions, particularly with regards to the \\nonus borne by the applicant at each successive detention review. In this case, even \\nwithout regard to this evidence, it was clear that the statutory scheme, including \\njudicial review at the Federal Courts, is not as advantageous as habeas corpus given \\nthe nature of the challenge.  \\n \\nVI. Conclusion \\n[71] Habeas corpus is a fundamental and historic remedy  which allows \\nindividuals to seek a determination as to the legality of their detention. A provincial \\nsuperior court should decline its habeas corpus jurisdiction only when faced with a \\ncomplete, comprehensive and expert scheme which provides review that i s at least as \\nbroad and advantageous as habeas corpus with respect to the grounds raised by the \\napplicant. Although our legal system continues to evolve, habeas corpus “remains as \\nfundamental to our modern conception of liberty as it was in the days of Kin g John” \\nand any exceptions to its availability must be carefully limited ( Charkaoui v. Canada \\n(Citizenship and Immigration) , 2007 SCC 9, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 350, at para. 28). The \\nIRPA has  been held to be a complete, comprehensive and expert scheme for \\nimmigration matters generally, but it is unable to respond to Mr. Chhina’s challenge \\nin a manner that is as broad and advantageous as habeas corpus and the Alberta Court \\nof Queen’s Bench erred in declining to hear Mr. Chhina’s habeas corpus application. \\nFor these reasons, I would allow the motion to adduce new evidence and dismiss the \\nappeal with costs on the basis agreed by the parties. \\n \\nThe following are the reasons delivered by \\n \\n ABELLA J. —  \\n \\n[72] I share the majority’s view that there should b e assertive and rigorous \\nscrutiny of the lawfulness of any deprivation of liberty. That is why, in my respectful \\nview, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA) should be \\ninterpreted in a way that guarantees the fullest possible r ange of scrutiny for \\ndetention, including the conditions of detention. I see nothing in the language of the \\nAct that precludes such a comprehensive review. In fact, I think the basis for the \\nentire scheme requires it. On the other hand, interpreting it in a way that restricts the \\ncontours of the scrutiny unduly interferes with the rights of the detainee and with the \\nlegislature’s intention that those rights be fully and generously integrated with the \\npurposes of the whole scheme. \\n[73] Moreover, interpreting the Act in a way that excludes the possibility of \\nreviewing all aspects of immigration detention, including its conditions and \\nlawfulness, essentially and inappropriately reads out the detention review process in \\nIRPA. Why would any detainee settle for a partial review of his or her detention under \\nIRPA if they could receive a more expansive one under habeas corpus? By narrowing \\nthe range of detention review available under IRPA, the majority’s interpretation has \\nthe effect of elevating habeas corpus  into the o nly meaningful route offering \\ndetainees a full review of their detention. This relegates the Act to a second-best role, \\nand creates a two -tier process of detention review whereby those who choose the \\nAct’s menu are deemed to be consigned to a lesser remedial buffet. \\n \\n[74] The better approach is to continue to read the language of IRPA in a \\nmanner that is as broad and advantageous as habeas corpus and ensures the complete, \\ncomprehensive and expert review of immigration detention that it was intended to \\nprovide, as  all of this Court’s previous jurisprudence has done. It is far more \\nconsistent with the purposes of the scheme to breathe the fullest possible remedial life \\ninto the Act than to essentially invite detainees to avoid the exclusive scheme and \\npursue their analogous remedies elsewhere. \\nI. Background \\n[75] Tusif Ur Rehman Chhina was born in Pakistan. He entered Canada in \\nDecember 2006 and obtained refugee status under a false name. When the Minister of \\nCitizenship and Immigration discovered Mr. Chhina’s misrepresentati on, he applied \\nto the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board to remove \\nMr. Chhina’s refugee status. \\n[76] The Refugee Protection Division granted the Minister’s application in \\nFebruary 2012. It determined that Mr. Chhina was inadmissibl e to Canada on the \\nbasis of serious criminality, and issued a deportation order against him. In response to \\nthe deportation order, the Canadian Border Services Agency began taking steps to \\nobtain the necessary travel documents for Mr. Chhina’s return to Pakistan. \\n[77] Before he could be deported from Canada, Mr. Chhina was convicted of \\nvarious criminal offences and incarcerated for three years. When he was released in \\n \\nApril 2013, Mr. Chhina was taken immediately into immigration detention on the \\ngrounds that he would likely pose a danger to the public and would be unlikely to \\nappear for his removal from Canada if released. \\n[78] As required by the Act, a member of the Immigration Division of the \\nImmigration and Refugee Board reviewed Mr. Chhina’s detention within 48 ho urs of \\nthis detention and again within 7 days. Thereafter, the Immigration Division reviewed \\nhis detention at least every 30 days. His release was ordered on terms and conditions \\nby Leeann King after a detention review in November 2013. Member King explained: \\n[I]t will be an indeterminate amount of time before Pakistan issues a \\ntravel document if they even ever do because there’s no way to know \\nwhat the holdup is at this point after full cooperation from Mr. Chhina \\nand his family. . . .  \\n \\nSo what I have to consider is the Regulations under 248 which are \\nborrowed verbatim from the decision of Sahin which relates to section 7 \\nof the Charter and detaining people for lengthy and indeterminate \\namounts of time when there are alternatives to look at, alternatives t o \\ndetention that could reduce the risks posed. \\n \\n(A.R., vol. II, at p. 106) \\n[79] Mr. Chhina breached the conditions of his release by failing to report to \\nthe Canadian Border Services Agency as required. Border Services issued a warrant \\nfor his arrest in Decembe r 2013, but Mr. Chhina could not be located for a year. He \\nwas finally arrested by the police in December 2014 for crimes committed since his \\nrelease. He was detained on those criminal charges until November 2015, at which \\npoint he was again taken directly into immigration detention. \\n \\n[80] The Immigration Division reviewed his detention the next day and \\nordered his continued detention on the bases that he was unlikely to appear for \\nremoval from Canada and that he posed a danger to the public. The Immigration \\nDivision continued to review Mr. Chhina’s detention as required by ss. 57 and 58 of \\nIRPA and s. 248 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations , SOR/2002-\\n227 ( Regulations), which guarantee immigration detainees like Mr. Chhina an \\nopportunity to chall enge the lawfulness of their detention before the Immigration \\nDivision at least every 30 days. \\n[81] Border Services continued its efforts to return Mr. Chhina to Pakistan. It \\nrequested travel documents from Pakistan on three occasions over three and one half \\nyears. Pakistan did not accede to these requests. While Pakistan had at one time \\nacknowledged that Mr. Chhina was a Pakistani citizen, it subsequently resiled from \\nthat position and said it would not issue a travel document because it could not verify \\nMr. Chhina’s national status. Border Services learned that Pakistan refused to issue a \\ntravel documen t in December 2015 and then made efforts to establish his true \\nidentity.  \\n[82] Mr. Chhina pursued the statutory remedies available to him to challenge \\nthe lawfulness of his continued detention under IRPA. But he also sought to access \\nthe alternative remedy of habeas corpus by emphasizing the constitutional nature of \\nhis challenge based on ss. 7, 9 and 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and \\nFreedoms. \\n \\n[83] The application judge in the Court of Queen’s Bench, Mahoney J., \\ndeclined to exercise habeas corpus jurisdiction on the basis that the IRPA scheme for \\nimmigration detention review provides a complete, comprehensive and expert \\nprocedure for the review of Immigration Division decisions. He found that the case \\nwas an immigration matter within the jurisdiction and expertise of the Federal Court. \\n[84] The Alberta Court of Appeal held that the application judge erred in \\ndeclining to exercise habeas corpus  jurisdiction. In its view, habeas corpus  review \\noffers greater advantages to detainees like Mr. Chhina than the IRPA scheme.  \\n[85] The Alberta Court of Appeal’s decision, which followed and endorsed the \\nCourt of Appeal for Ontario’s decision in Chaudhary v. Canada (Minister of Public \\nSafety & Emergency Preparedness)  (2015), 127 O.R. (3d) 401 (C.A), departed from \\nsettled law. This C ourt has repeatedly held that the IRPA scheme for the review of \\nimmigration detention decisions is a complete, comprehensive and expert scheme that \\nis at least as broad as, and no less advantageous than, review by way of habeas \\ncorpus. I see no reason to d epart from it now. If anything, this case presents an \\nopportunity to confirm that the process and substance of detention reviews under \\nIRPA should be as advantageous as habeas corpus, so that detainees get expeditious \\naccess to the fullest possible review of the terms and conditions of their detention. \\nII. Analysis \\n \\n[86] Habeas corpus , the traditional route to assessing the lawfulness of \\ndeprivations of liberty, has historic roots which have spawned a variety of statutory \\nremedies whose goal is to preserve the same p rotections. These can be found, among \\nother statutes, in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C -46, which confers jurisdiction \\non appellate courts to correct the errors of a lower court and release the applicant (see, \\nfor example, R. v. Gamble, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 595, at pp. 636 -37; R. v. Pearson, [1992] \\n3 S.C.R. 665 (bail review); and Staetter v. British Columbia (Adult Forensic \\nPsychiatric Services), 2017 BCCA 68 (Review Board custodial dispositions)). \\n[87] They are also found in IRPA. Their legitimacy as a genuine  alternative to \\nhabeas corpus was judicially considered and endorsed in Pringle v. Fraser , [1972] \\nS.C.R. 821; Peiroo v. Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration)  (1989), 69 \\nO.R. (2d) 253 (C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [1989] 2 S.C.R. x; Reza v. Canad a, \\n[1994] 2 S.C.R. 394; May v. Ferndale Institution, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 809. Each of these \\ndecisions emphasized that the habeas corpus -like remedies available in what was \\nintended to be an exclusive statutory scheme, were “as broad as or broader than the \\ntraditional scope of review by way of habeas corpus” (Peiroo, at p. 261). \\n[88] The issue in this appeal is whether that remains the case, namely, that the \\nimmigration scheme is able to continue to provide as fulsome a package of \\nprotections as does habeas corpus , o r whether the scheme no longer provides \\nanalogous benefits, thereby justifying a departure from our jurisprudence. \\n \\n[89] Statutory schemes like IRPA that replace habeas corpus  with equally \\neffective remedies have long been upheld (Judith Farbey and Robert J. Sha rpe, with \\nSimon Atrill, The Law of Habeas Corpus  (3rd ed. 2011), at p. 49). As the Court of \\nAppeal for Ontario recently observed in Ogiamien v. Ontario (Community Safety and \\nCorrectional Services)  (2017), 55 Imm. L.R. (4th) 220 (Ont. C.A.), habeas corpus  \\ncannot be used to mount a collateral attack on immigration decisions for which a \\ncomprehensive review process exists (para. 14). \\n[90] The statutory scheme for immigration detention review set out in IRPA, \\ntogether with the Regulations and the Immigration Divisio n Rules , SOR/2002 -229, \\nmandates prompt, regular, accessible and Charter-compliant review of immigration \\ndetention decisions by the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee \\nBoard, an independent, quasi -judicial administrative tribunal with specia lized \\nknowledge of immigration matters, including immigration detention. \\n[91] The IRPA scheme was intended to provide the same fulsome, Charter-\\ncompliant review of immigration detention as habeas corpus. Section 3(3)(d) of IRPA \\ncodifies the Immigration Division members’ obligation to exercise their discretion in \\naccordance with the Charter: \\nApplication \\n \\n(3) This Act is to be construed and applied in a manner that \\n \\n. . .  \\n \\n \\n(d) ensures that decisions taken under this Act are consi stent with \\nthe Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , including its principles of \\nequality and freedom from discrimination and of the equality of English \\nand French as the official languages of Canada \\n \\n. . . \\n[92] This means that the Charter governs the exerci se of discretion under the \\nAct and informs the interpretation of its provisions in a manner that allows for the \\nfullest possible review of a detainee’s loss of liberty. The Act must therefore be \\ninterpreted in a way that does not circumscribe its purposes but instead gives it the \\nwidest possible scope for implementing its objectives through rigorous substantive \\ndetention review. The application of the Charter to the IRPA scheme guarantees the \\nfull panoply of rights to detained individuals. This extends to m atters of timeliness \\nand access to the statutory remedies, the nature of the review, onus and expertise. \\n[93]  The suggestion that a full review of detention can only occur under \\nhabeas corpus is a bow to the seductive attraction of the label without recognizin g \\nthat it unnecessarily fetters the comprehensive review of the lawfulness of detention \\nprovided in the Act. It also departs from a longstanding jurisprudential consensus: that \\nthe IRPA scheme for the review of immigration detention decisions provides a \\nremedy to detainees that is at least as broad, and no less advantageous than review by \\nway of habeas corpus . In my respectful view, there is no principled reason to \\nabandon the sound logic in Pringle, Peiroo, Reza and May. \\n \\n[94] At the time Pringle was decided in 1972, the Immigration Appeal Board \\nAct, S.C. 1966 -67, c. 90, had recently been amended to provide a scheme for the \\nreview of deportation orders by the Immigration Appeal Board, an independent \\nadministrative tribunal vested with all the powers of a superior  court of record. The \\napplicant appealed to the Board after an immigration official issued a deportation \\norder against him. At the same time, he commenced certiorari proceedings in the \\nsuperior court to have the deportation order quashed. His application f or certiorari \\nwas dismissed at first instance but granted on appeal to the Court of Appeal for \\nOntario. Before this Court, the appeal turned on whether the superior court had \\ncertiorari jurisdiction to quash a deportation order made pursuant to the Immigration \\nAct, R.S.C. 1952, c. 325. \\n[95] Laskin J. concluded that amendments to the Immigration Appeal Board \\nAct establishing the Immigration Appeal Board and conferring certain power to it had \\n“brought into the law a wider avenue for initial appeal from deportation  orders than \\ntheretofore existed” (p. 825). He wrote: \\n[The Immigration Appeal Board Act ] and the  Immigration Act , and the \\nRegulations promulgated under each of them, constitute a code for the \\nadministration of immigration matters and for the review of proceedings \\nin such matters. There is no common law of immigration. Parliament’s \\nauthority to establish such a code is not challenged; nor is Parliament’s \\nauthority to deny or remove  certiorari jurisdiction from provincial \\nsuperior courts over deportation orders. [p. 825] \\n[96] Laskin J. held that the amended Immigration Appeal Board Act , with its \\nnew scheme for the administrative review of immigration deportation orders, ousted \\n \\nthe certiorari jurisdiction of the superior court . He rejected the contention that \\nParliament, in enacting the new immigration scheme, had not clearly expressed an \\nintention that the scheme should remove certiorari jurisdiction from the provincial \\nsuperior courts. On the contrary, he saw s. 22 of the sch eme as expressly endowing \\nthe Immigration Appeal Board with “sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and \\ndetermine all questions of fact or law, including questions of jurisdiction”. In Laskin \\nJ.’s view, the plain meaning of the statute was to exclude any other court or tribunal \\nfrom entertaining the same proceedings: \\nThe result I would reach goes beyond literal justification in the \\nlanguage of s. 22. The facts of the present case show the incompatibility \\nof the appellate jurisdiction vested in the Board wi th the survival \\nof certiorari in provincial superior courts. It was not suggested that the \\nappeal to the Board would be aborted by proceedings to quash taken in \\nthe Supreme Court of Ontario. In fact, Fraser did not abandon his appeal \\nupon taking  certiorari proceedings. However, I do not propose to deal \\nwith this case as if an election of remedies had been made and that this \\nmust determine the outcome. Certainly, the likelihood of two conflicting \\ndecisions (each ultimately appealable to this Court) has nothi ng to \\ncommend it. The only practical resolution is to recognize the \\nexclusiveness of the special procedure ordained by Parliament. [pp. 825 -\\n26] \\n[97] Laskin J. compared certiorari to habeas corpus , holding that both are \\nremedial proceedings whose “availability m ay depend on whether [they are] \\nprescribed as a remedy by the competent legislature” (p. 826, citing In re Storgoff , \\n[1945] S.C.R. 526). These remedies have “no necessary ongoing life in relation to all \\nmatters for which [they] could be used, if competent excluding legislation is enacted” \\n(pp. 826-27). \\n \\n[98] The principles articulated in Pringle were adopted in Peiroo. In Peiroo, \\nthe applicant made a refugee claim in Canada. The  Convention Refugee \\nDetermination Division of the  Immigration and Refugee Board determined there was \\nno credible basis to her claim and issued a removal order pursuant to the provisions of \\nwhat was then the Immigration Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. I -2. Ms. Peiroo was placed in \\nimmigration detention. She sought to contest the finding of no credible basis and the \\nremoval order by applying to the provincial superior court for habeas corpus  with \\ncertiorari in aid. Her application was dismissed and she appealed to the Court of \\nAppeal for Ontario. \\n[99] The Court of Appeal considered whether it should decline t o exercise its \\nhabeas corpus  jurisdiction to review Ms. Peiroo’s detention in favour of the \\nalternative remedies available to her to challenge the impugned immigration \\ndecisions. Catzman J.A., writing for the court, noted that habeas corpus  is an \\nextraordinary remedy that does not generally lie where there is an alternative remedy \\navailable (see Peiroo, at p. 257, citing Cameron Harvey, The Law of Habeas Corpus \\nin Canada  (1974), at p. 13; Roger Salhany,  Canadian Criminal Procedure  (4th ed. \\n1984), at p. 521). \\n[100] Catzman J.A. compared habeas corpus with the available remedies under \\nthe Immigration Act to challenge removal orders and credible basis findings. The Act \\nexpressly provided for an appeal with leave to the Federal Court of Canada. Catzman \\nJ.A. observed that the grounds and scope of review set out in the appeal provisions of \\n \\nthe Federal Court Ac t, R.S.C. 1985, c. F -7, “are as broad as, and — in the power to \\nexamine erroneous findings of fact — probably broader than, those on which the \\n[superior court] exercises its jurisdiction on applications for habeas corpus  with \\ncertiorari in aid” (p. 258). \\n[101] Catzman J.A. concluded that the review and appeal mechanisms \\ncontemplated in the Act were “as broad as or broader than the traditional scope of \\nreview by way of habeas corpus”. As a result, the statutory scheme did not run afoul \\nof the principle that indivi duals “should not be refused the ancient remedy of habeas \\ncorpus on account of the availability of some less expeditious and advantageous \\nalternative remedy” ( p. 258, citing R. v. Governor of Pentonville Prison, ex \\nparte Azam, [1974] A.C. 18 (C.A.), at p. 758, aff’d  [1974] A.C. 49 (H.L.) ). He \\nexplained: \\nParliament has established in the [ Immigration Act ], particularly in the \\nrecent amendments which specifically address the disposition of claims \\nof persons in the position of the appellant, a  comprehensive sc heme to \\nregulate the determination of such claims and to provide for review and \\nappeal in the Federal Court of Canada of decisions and orders made \\nunder the Act, the ambit of which review and appeal  is as broad as or \\nbroader than  the traditional scope of r eview by way of  habeas \\ncorpus with certiorari in aid. In the absence of any showing that the \\navailable review and appeal process established by Parliament \\nis inappropriate or less advantageous  than the habeas corpus jurisdiction \\nof the [provincial superior  court], it is my view that this court should, in \\nthe exercise of its discretion, decline to grant relief upon the application \\nfor habeas corpus  in the present case, which clearly falls within the \\npurview of that statutory review and appeal process. \\n \\nI am fortified in this conclusion by the observation that similar \\nconsiderations appear to have moved the Supreme Court of Canada to \\nhold that where there is a legislative initiative purporting to provide a \\n \\nwhole scheme or code for the administration and review  of proceedings \\nin a field like immigration ( Pringle v. Fraser  . . . [1972] S.C.R. 821), or \\nhuman rights ( Board of Governors of Seneca College of Applied Arts & \\nTechnology v. Bhadauria  . . . [1981] 2 S.C.R. 181 . . .), such a scheme \\nshould not be bypassed,  either by evolving a new cause of action (as \\nin Bhadauria) or by the use of a prerogative writ (as in  Pringle). Both \\njurisprudence and logic would suggest that this Court should leave the \\nreview of immigration matters with the Federal Court of Canada, whi ch \\nhas review and appeal jurisdiction with respect to many aspects of \\nimmigration law and which has geographical jurisdiction throughout \\nCanada, and thus can deal with claims of refugee claimants wherever \\ntheir point of entry. [pp. 261-62] \\n[102] This became known as “the Peiroo exception”, namely, where Parliament \\nhas put in place a complete, comprehensive and expert statutory scheme providing for \\nreview of detention that is at least as broad as, and no less advantageous than habeas \\ncorpus review, superior courts  should decline to exercise their habeas corpus  \\njurisdiction in favour of that statutory scheme. \\n[103] This Court applied the Peiroo exception in Reza. Like Peiroo, Reza \\ninvolved a refugee claim. Mr. Reza claimed protection in Canada as a Convention \\nrefugee. A t ribunal established under the Transitional Provisions of the Immigration \\nAct, R.S.C. 1985, c. 28 (4th Supp.), determined that there was no credible basis to his \\nclaim and issued a deportation order against him. Mr. Reza was unsuccessful at his \\nreview by an  immigration officer on humanitarian grounds and sought leave to \\ncommence judicial review of the immigration officer’s decision in the Federal Court. \\n[104] Mr. Reza subsequently challenged the constitutionality of the \\nImmigration Act  in the superior court. The m otion judge stayed the constitutional \\n \\nchallenge because the Federal Court had concurrent jurisdiction and was the more \\nappropriate forum for the challenge. Concluding that he was bound by Peiroo, he \\nsaid: \\nIn the absence of any showing that the available re view process and \\nappeal process is inappropriate or less advantageous than the habeas \\ncorpus jurisdiction of this Court, this Court should, in the exercise of its \\ndiscretion, decline to grant relief on a habeas corpus  application. Both \\njurisprudence and lo gic would support that this Court should leave the \\nreview of the immigration matters with the Federal Court of Canada:  Re \\nPeiroo (1989), 69 O.R. (2d) 253  (O.C.A.). To the same effect is the C.A. \\ndecision in Sheperd (1989), 52 C.C.C. (3d) 386. I am of cours e bound by \\nthese decisions. \\n \\nThe case at bar does not involve an application for habeas corpus \\nrelief, but the relief sought, by way of declaration and injunctive relief, is \\nalso discretionary in this Court. The Federal Court has jurisdiction to \\ngrant the relief sought in this application and in my view the principles \\nset out by the C.A. in  Peiroo and in Sheperd are applicable to the case at \\nbar. The circumstances described by Campbell in  Bembeneck, 69 C.C.C. \\n(3d) 34, which influenced the court to take juri sdiction, are not present \\nhere. \\n \\nAs to whether the process is less advantageous in the Federal Court, \\nas indicated, the relief is available in that court and in my view the \\nrequirement of leave in that court to make a claim for a declaratory \\njudgment does not make the process less advantageous . . . . \\n \\nAccordingly, it is my view that this proceeding should be stayed \\nand I so order. [pp. 399-400] \\n[105] A majority in the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversed the motion \\njudge’s decision. This Court allowed the appeal on the basis of the comprehensive \\nscheme dealing with the same issues. The Immigration Act in force at the time gave \\nthe Federal Court an excl usive statutory mandate over immigration matters. As in \\nPeiroo, the Court found that Parliament, in enacting the Immigration Act and granting \\n \\nexclusive jurisdiction to the Federal Court, intended the Federal Court to be the \\nappropriate forum for deciding i mmigration cases. This weighed against the exercise \\nof concurrent jurisdiction, suggesting instead that the statutory grant of exclusive \\njurisdiction to the Federal Court demonstrated legislative intent to bar individuals \\nfrom pursuing parallel remedies in the superior courts. \\n[106] Second, the factors of expertise and experience also favoured the Federal \\nCourt’s exclusive mandate over immigration matters. The Federal Court has expertise \\nin immigration law, administrative law, and Federal Court procedure. While o n the \\nsurface Mr. Reza’s case appeared to be a constitutional one, at its core the nature of \\nthe Charter challenge was fundamentally linked with immigration policy and process. \\n[107] Third, superior courts should decline to exercise jurisdiction in \\nimmigration cases where the Federal Court has concurrent jurisdiction to avoid issues \\nof forum-shopping, inconsistent decision making and multiplicity of proceedings (see \\nalso Reference re Constitution Act, 1867, s. 92(10)(a)  (1988), 64 O.R. (2d) 393 \\n(C.A.)). \\n[108] The motio n judge had therefore rightly declined to exercise jurisdiction \\non the basis that Parliament had created a comprehensive scheme of review of \\nimmigration matters and the Federal Court was an effective and appropriate forum. \\n[109] This Court considered Pringle, Peiroo and Reza in May. In May, we \\nconfirmed two exceptions to the availability of habeas corpus: it is not available to \\n \\nchallenge the legality of a criminal conviction where a statute provides for a right of \\nappeal; and it is not available “in matters of im migration law, because Parliament has \\nput in place a complete, comprehensive and expert statutory scheme which provides \\nfor a review at least as broad as that available by way of habeas corpus and no less \\nadvantageous, habeas corpus is precluded”, namely the Peiroo exception (para. 40). \\n[110] The grievance procedures under s. 81(1) of the Corrections and \\nConditional Release Regulations, SOR/92-620, were at issue in May: \\n81 (1)  Where an offender decides to pursue a legal remedy for the \\noffender’s complaint or grievance in addition to the complaint and \\ngrievance procedure referred to in these Regulations, the review of the \\ncomplaint or grievance pursuant to these Regulations shal l be deferred \\nuntil a decision on the alternate remedy is rendered or the offender \\ndecides to abandon the alternate remedy. \\n[111] The Court concluded that this language did not reveal a legislative \\nintention to oust the superior courts’ habeas corpus  jurisdiction (para. 60). Instead, \\nthe statute was found to contemplate that an inmate may choose to pursue a remedy \\nlike habeas corpus  in addition to filing an administrative grievance. The language \\nreflected a legislative intent that the statutory scheme operate in conjunction with the \\nsuperior courts’ habeas corpus jurisdiction. \\n[112] The Court held that for immigration detainees seeking to challenge their \\ncontinued detention as a violation of their Charter rights, the IRPA scheme governing \\nmatters of immigration law was a complete, comprehensive and expert scheme that is \\n \\nat least as broad as, and no less advantageous than review by way of habeas corpus in \\nterms of expertise, onus, the nature of the remedy, and timeliness. Provincial superior \\ncourts should, as a result, de cline to exercise their concurrent jurisdiction to review \\nimmigration detention by way of habeas corpus  in favour of review before the \\nImmigration Division and the Federal Court under the IRPA scheme. \\n[113] Section 162(1) of IRPA confirms the clear legislative i ntent to grant \\nexclusive original jurisdiction to the Immigration Division over immigration matters: \\nSole and exclusive jurisdiction \\n \\n162 (1)  Each Division of the Board has, in respect of proceedings \\nbrought before it under this Act, sole and  exclusive jurisdiction to hear \\nand determine all questions of law and fact, including questions of \\njurisdiction. \\nIn Pringle, Laskin J. found that this language barred courts from entertaining the \\ntypes of immigration proceedings over which the Board had been granted e xclusive \\nstatutory authority. This specialized and exclusive expertise underlies the Peiroo \\nexception to the availability of habeas corpus review in immigration matters. \\n[114] This Court has consistently endorsed the Peiroo exception limiting the \\navailability of habeas corpus  review for immigration matters. In the absence of \\nevidence that the “complete, comprehensive and expert statutory scheme” does not \\nprovide for a review at least as broad and no less advantageous than habeas corpus, I \\nsee no reason to disturb the Court’s jurisprudence by opening an alternative route, one \\n \\nthat will lead to the forum shopping, inconsistent decision making, and multiplicity of \\nproceedings the Court warned against in Reza. There is nothing in the language of the \\nstatutory scheme that restricts the scope of IRPA detention review to a partial review \\nwhich must be supplemented by habeas corpus. On the contrary, the IRPA scheme is \\nstructured to provide detainees with at least the same rights they would receive on \\nhabeas corpus review. \\n[115] To begin, the IRPA scheme for immigration detention review provides \\nthat all detentions must be reviewed regularly. Individuals detained for immigration \\npurposes have the right to appear before the Immigration Divisio n within 48 hours \\nfollowing their initial detention (s. 57(1)). A second review must take place during \\nthe next seven days, and regular reviews at least once every 30 days thereafter (s. \\n57(2)). The detainee may make an application to the Immigration Divis ion requesting \\na detention review before the expiry of the seven or 30 -day period ( Immigration \\nDivision Rules, r. 9). Review hearings are structured to be expeditious and accessible, \\nand they must be dealt with as informally and quickly as the circumstance s and \\nconsiderations of fairness and natural justice permit. \\n[116] The IRPA scheme provides that immigration officers are responsible for \\nbringing the detainee before the Immigration Division for all review hearings (s. \\n57(3)). The Immigration Division has a cor responding power to order immigration \\nofficials to bring the detainee to a location specified by the Division ( Immigration \\nDivision Rules , r. 23). The Immigration Division can also facilitate access to the \\n \\nremedy by requiring the parties to appear at a con ference to discuss any matter that \\nwould make the proceedings more fair and efficient, or to participate in scheduling \\nthe proceedings (Immigration Division Rules, rr. 20(1) and 21). \\n[117] Upon conducting a detention review, the Immigration Division may order \\nthe continued detention of a detainee, their unconditional release, or their release on \\nany conditions the Immigration Division considers necessary. The Immigration \\nDivision makes its decisions in furtherance of the purposes of IRPA, which include \\nprotecting public safety and maintaining the security of Canadian society (s. 3(1)(h)). \\n[118] While the majority of detention review hearings occur before the \\nImmigration Division, a detainee who is dissatisfied with the Immigration Division’s \\ndecision, whether on Charter grounds or otherwise, may apply for leave and judicial \\nreview to the Federal Court ( IRPA, s. 72(1)). I agree with the comments of Catzman \\nJ.A. in Peiroo, rejecting the argument that the requirement for leave to appeal \\nimmigration decisions to the Federal Court rendered that remedy less advantageous \\nthan habeas corpus, where leave is not required. Catzman J.A. wrote: \\nI consider the suggested distinction to be more apparent than real. In \\norder to succeed on an application for habeas corpus, an applicant must  \\nshow reasonable and probable ground for his complaint:  Habeas Corpus \\nAct, R.S.O. 1980, c. 193, s. 1(1). The requirement for leave imposed by s. \\n83.1(1) is clearly intended to be one of a series of screening mechanisms \\ncreated by the Act to discour[a]ge th e assertion of spurious or meritless \\nclaims. I have difficulty accepting that an applicant who is in a position to \\nshow reasonable and probable ground for complaint regarding the \\ndecision or order in respect of which he seeks review would fail to be \\naccorded the requisite leave to bring an application for such review. \\n \\nIndeed, counsel have advised that such leave was granted in the present \\ncase . . . [p. 259] \\n[119] Mr. Chhina’s application for judicial review before the Federal Court \\nwas, in fact, expedited. It to ok one week less to be heard and decided than his \\napplication for habeas corpus before the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench. \\n[120] In any event, the requirement for leave to appeal to the Federal Court \\ndoes not change the nature of the comprehensive detention revi ew process under \\nIRPA, which is governed by s. 58 of IRPA and s. 248 of the Regulations. The \\nImmigration Division must order the release of a detainee unless the Minister has \\nsatisfied the Immigration Division that one or more of the grounds in s. 58(1) of IRPA \\nare met: \\n(a) The detainee is a danger to the public; \\n \\n(b) The detainee is unlikely to appear for examination, an admissibility \\nhearing, removal from Canada, or at a proceeding that could lead to the \\nmaking of a removal order by the Minister; \\n \\n(c) Th e Minister is taking necessary steps to inquire into a reasonable \\nsuspicion that the detainee is inadmissible on grounds of security, \\nviolating human or international rights, serious criminality, criminality or \\norganized criminality;  \\n \\n(d) The detainee’s id entity has not been, but may be, established; or  \\n \\n(e) If the detainee is a designated foreign national, the Minister is of the \\nopinion that the identity of the detainee has not been established. \\n \\n[121] If s. 58 grounds are established, s. 248 of the Regulations requires the \\nImmigration Division to consider the following additional factors to determine if \\ndetention should continue: \\n(a) The reason for detention; \\n \\n(b) Length of time in detention; \\n \\n(c) Factors that may assist in determining how long detention is likely to \\ncontinue; \\n \\n(d) Delays or lack of diligence on the detainee or the government’s part; \\nand \\n \\n(e) Alternatives to detention. \\n[122] The factors in s. 248 of the Regulations codify the factors articulated by \\nRothstein J. in Sahin v. Canada (Minister of Citiz enship and Immigration) , [1995] 1 \\nF.C. 214 (T.D.). The s. 248 factors were endorsed by this Court in Charkaoui v. \\nCanada (Citizenship and Immigration) , [2007] 1 S.C.R. 350. They ensure that \\nextended periods of detention do not violate the Charter. \\n[123] As Rothstein J. noted in Sahin, through IRPA, “Parliament has dealt with \\nthe right of society to be protected from those who pose a danger to society and the \\nright of Canada to control who enters and remains in this country” (p. 229). To \\nachieve these purposes, th e IRPA scheme confers upon members of the Immigration \\nDivision the power to detain individuals in anticipation of their likely danger to the \\npublic or likely failure to appear for removal from Canada. \\n \\n[124] When making a decision as to whether to detain or relea se an individual \\nunder IRPA, Immigration Division members must always exercise their discretion in a \\nway that accords with the Charter (see IRPA, s. 3(3)(d)). There is a statutory \\npresumption in favour of release before the Immigration Division, which “shall order \\nthe release” of a detainee unless it is satisfied that at least one of the grounds set out \\nin s. 58 of IRPA is met, taking into account the factors in s. 248 of the Regulations. \\n[125] Significantly, the mandatory s. 248 inquiry on review before the \\nImmigration Division requires the Division to assess the lawfulness of ongoing \\nimmigration detention without placing any onus on the detainee. Unlik e habeas \\ncorpus applications, where the detainee must raise a legitimate ground upon which to \\nquestion the lawfulness of his or her detention, the Minister bears the onus throughout \\nof justifying the detention before the Immigration Division. The detainee bears no \\nonus to produce evidence as to any of the factors enunciated in s. 58 of IRPA or s. 248 \\nof the Regulations. \\n[126] To the extent that the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada (Minister of \\nCitizenship and Immigration) v. Thanabalasingham , [2004] 3 F.C.R. 572 , and the \\nCourt of Appeal for Ontario in Chaudhary reached the contrary conclusion, they \\nwere, in my respectful view, wrongly decided. Moreover, the holding in Chaudhary \\nthat the Minister can satisfy his or her onus before the Immigration Division “simply \\nby relying on the reasons given at prior detention hearings” (para. 87) is inconsistent \\nwith the Immigration Division’s obligation to conduct a fresh inquiry into the \\n \\nlawfulness of detention at each review. At each Immigration Division hearing, \\ndetainees are entitled to the same fresh review of their detention as they would be on \\nhabeas corpus  review. In cases like Mr. Chhina’s, the Immigration Division must \\nalways reassess the prior evidence in light of the detainee’s Charter arguments. \\n[127] In particular, where a detainee challenges their detention as a violation of \\nthe Charter, the time between the prior and present review hearing will constitute \\nnew evidence that must inform the Immigration Division’s application of s. 58 of \\nIRPA and s. 248 of the Regulations. It is not enough for the Minister to rely on \\nprevious Immigration Division decisions to satisfy the Immigration Division on the s. \\n58 and  \\ns. 248 inquiry. The integrity of the IRPA process is dependent on a fulsome review of \\nthe lawfulness of detention, including its Charter compliance, at every review \\nhearing. \\n[128] The Charter both guides the exercise of discretionary administrative \\ndecision making under IRPA and informs our interpretation of the scheme itself. The \\nIRPA scheme must therefore be interpreted harmoniously with the Charter values that \\nshape the contours of its application. As Justices Iacobucci and Arbour stated in \\nApplication under s. 83.28 of the Criminal Code (Re), [2004] 2 S.C.R. 248: \\nThe modern approach [to statutory interpretation] recognize s the multi -\\nfaceted nature of statutory interpretation. Textual considerations must be \\nread in concert with legislative intent and established legal norms.  \\n \\n \\nUnderlying this approach is the presumption that legislation is enacted to \\ncomply with constitutio nal norms, including the rights and freedoms \\nenshrined in the Charter . . . . This presumption acknowledges the \\ncentrality of constitutional values in the legislative process, and more \\nbroadly, in the political and legal culture of Canada. [paras. 34-35] \\n[129] Importing Charter principles into the exercise of administrative discretion \\nunder IRPA requires that Immigration Division members apply the scheme in a \\nmanner that is at least as rigorous and fair as habeas corpus review. It is not enough \\nthat a statutory s cheme is as broad and advantageous on paper as habeas corpus  \\nreview, the scheme must also be applied in a manner that preserves the rights of \\ndetainees and the integrity of the process in the most comprehensive way possible. \\n[130] That means that in carrying out  their duties under the IRPA scheme, \\nmembers of the Immigration Division must ensure the fullest possible review of \\nimmigration detention. This includes, and has always included, an obligation to weigh \\nthe purposes served by immigration detention against t he detained individual’s ss. 7, \\n9 and 12 Charter rights. The Immigration Division’s inquiry into the lawfulness of \\ndetention must take into account the detained individual’s s. 7 Charter right not to be \\ndeprived of liberty except in accordance with the pri nciples of fundamental justice, \\nhis or her s. 9 right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned, and the s. 12 right not \\nto be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. As Rothstein J. \\nobserved in Sahin, “it is not the words of [ IRPA] that  vest adjudicators with such \\njurisdiction, but rather, the application of Charter principles to the exercise of \\ndiscretion under [the scheme]” (p. 230). \\n \\n[131] That, in my respectful view, necessarily includes the Immigration \\nDivision’s ability to consider the co nditions of detention. A comprehensive, Charter-\\ninfused analysis of immigration detention may reveal that the length or conditions of \\ndetention are such that continued detention is not in accordance with the principles of \\nfundamental justice (s. 7), is arb itrary because it is no longer reasonably furthering \\nthe state objective (s. 9) and/or amounts to cruel and unusual punishment (s. 12). The \\napplication of ss. 7, 9 and 12 of the Charter to the IRPA scheme brings to light the \\nImmigration Division’s obligation to assess the length, future duration and conditions \\nof detention  when balancing the state’s objectives against the detained individual’s \\nrights. \\n[132] The IRPA scheme therefore ensures the protection of other Charter rights \\nby calling on the Immigration Divi sion to consider whether detentions have become \\nunlawful because of their length, uncertain duration and conditions. There is no \\nprincipled reason to interpret the review provisions in a way that precludes scrutiny of \\nconditions. Why apply a narrow, constrictive interpretation of a remedial statute when \\na wider, more protective interpretation is not only available, it is mandated by the \\npurposes underlying the scheme. As these reasons seek to clarify, the s. 248 factors \\nguide the Immigration Division in ass essing whether ongoing detention is justified \\npursuant to the Charter based on: \\n(a) The reason for detention; \\n \\n(b) Length of time in detention; \\n \\n \\n(c) Factors that may assist in determining how long detention is likely to \\ncontinue; \\n \\n(d) Delays or lack of dil igence on the detainee or the government’s part; \\nand \\n \\n(e) Alternatives to detention. \\n[133] Section 248(a) requires the Immigration Division to weigh the state’s \\nimmigration objectives against the detained individual’s right to be free from \\narbitrary or indefinit e restraints on liberty. As in habeas corpus  review assessing \\ncompliance with the Charter, the Immigration Division must assess the strength of \\nthe reason for detention. A prior, fact -driven Immigration Division determination that \\nthe individual constitutes a flight risk or a danger to the public is entitled to deference \\non both IRPA and habeas corpus review (see Thanabalasingham, at para. 10 ( IRPA \\nreview) and Brown v. Canada (Public Safety) (2018), 420 D.L.R. (4t h) 124 (Ont. \\nC.A.), at para. 29 ( habeas corpus  review)). The greater the danger posed to the \\npublic, the stronger the justification for ongoing detention ( Sahin, at p. 231 ( IRPA \\nreview); Ali v. Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)  \\n(2017), 137 O.R. (3d) 498 (C.A.), at para. 24 (habeas corpus review)). \\n[134] As for s. 248(b), the justification for continued detention decreases as the \\nlength of time in detention increases. The Immigration Division must accord \\n“significant weight” to the length of detention (see Sahin, at pp. 231-32). The strength \\nof an immigration detainee’s argument that his ongoing detention has become a \\nviolation of the Charter increases with each subsequent review hearing. The detaining \\n \\nauthorities bear a correlative onus  to justify continued detention in the face of a \\ncontinually solidifying Charter claim. A longer period of detention signifies that \\nimmigration authorities have had more time to effect removal, which they are \\nexpected to do as soon as reasonably possible. Accordingly, the evidentiary burden on \\nthe detaining authority to justify continued immigration detention increases as the \\nlength of detention increases. This approach to the length of detention is no different \\nfrom habeas corpus (see Chaudhary, Ali and Brown). \\n[135] The anticipated future length of detention in s. 248(c) of the Regulations \\nrequires an estimation of how long detention is likely to continue. A detention that is \\nlawful for the purpose of removal may become arbitrary and in violation of s. 9 of the \\nCharter when it becomes unhinged from its immigration -related purpose. Where \\nremoval appears unlikely and the future duration of detention cannot be ascertained, \\nthis is a factor that weighs in favour of release ( Sahin, at p. 231; Charkaoui, at para. \\n115). \\n[136] That is the same inquiry as in habeas corpus  review. As Rouleau J.A. \\nnoted in Chaudhary: \\nA detention cannot be justified if it is no longer reasonably necessary to \\nfurther the machinery of immigration control. Where there is no \\nreasonable prospect that the detention’s immigration -related purposes \\nwill be achieved within a reasonable time (with what is reasonable \\ndepending on the circumstances), a continued detention will violate the \\ndetainee’s ss. 7 and 9 Charter rights and no longer be legal. [para. 81] \\n \\n[137] The Immigration Division is, moreover, better positioned to assess and \\naddress the future duration of detention than the superior courts on habeas corpus  \\nreview. As Létourneau J.A. held for the court in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and \\nImmigration) v. Li, [2010] 2 F.C.R. 433 (C.A.), the short 30-day period between each \\nImmigration Division review “allows for an estimation based on actual facts and \\npending proceedings instead of an estimation based on speculation as to potential \\nfacts and proceedings” (p ara. 66). The Immigration Division obtains an accurate \\npicture of the detention every 30 days. It can assess progress over time by reviewing \\npast proceedings and anticipating pending proceedings to guard against a violation of \\nthe detainee’s Charter rights. \\n[138] Section 248(d) requires a consideration of delays or lack of diligence on \\nthe part of the detained individual or the immigration authorities. As Rothstein J. held \\nin Sahin and this Court held in Charkaoui, unexplained delay or lack of diligence \\nshould count against the offending party ( Sahin, at p. 231; Charkaoui, at para. 114). \\nSuperior courts reviewing immigration detention for compliance with ss. 7, 9 and 12 \\nof the Charter undertake the same inquiry. They look to the complexity of effecting \\nthe applica nt’s removal from Canada, the reasonableness of the steps taken by \\nimmigration authorities to effect removal, and the extent to which the applicant has \\nprolonged their detention by failing to cooperate with immigration authorities’ \\nremoval efforts (see Brown, at para. 36; Canada v. Dadzie, 2016 ONSC 6045, at para. \\n46). \\n \\n[139] In Dadzie, a foreign national detained under IRPA applied to be released \\nby way of habeas corpus. Clark J. applied the Charkaoui and Sahin principles about \\ndelay and diligence in immigration review in the habeas corpus context (para. 36). \\nMr. Dadzie’s lack of cooperation led Clark J. to conclude that Mr. Dadzie had not met \\nhis onus of showing that his detention had been exceptionally lengthy. \\n[140] Finally, s. 248(e) of the Regulations requires the Immigration Division to \\nconsider alternatives to detention. Alternatives to detention include outright release; a \\nbond or guarantee; reporting requirements; confinement to a specific geographic area; \\nand detention in a less restrictive form ( Sahin, at para. 30). An assessment of the \\nconditions of detention is a vital component of the inquiry into alternatives to \\ndetention under s. 248(e). Given the Immigration Division’s statutory mandate to \\nassess altern atives to detention; the requirement to make Charter-compliant \\ndecisions; and its ability to exercise discretion as to the terms of release, the \\nDivision’s power to release a detainee on conditions must include an ability to modify \\nthe conditions of detent ion. Like the provincial superior courts on habeas corpus  \\nreview, Immigration Division members must be taken to have the power to release \\nthe detainee from a “prison within a prison” pursuant to s. 58(3) (see R. v. Miller , \\n[1985] 2 S.C.R. 613, at p. 637, p er  \\nLe Dain J.; Robert J. Sharpe, The Law of Habeas Corpus (1976), at p. 149). \\n[141] In sum, the process of review before the Immigration Division governed \\nby s. 58 of IRPA and s. 248 of the Regulations demands that the Division consider the \\n \\nreasons for detention; the length of time in detention; the anticipated future length of \\ndetention; delays or lack of diligence; and the availability, effectiveness and \\nappropriateness of alternatives to detention, including changes in the conditions of \\ndetention. These are t he same considerations that superior courts weigh to assess \\nwhether ongoing immigration detention violates ss. 7, 9 or 12 of the Charter on \\nhabeas corpus review. \\n[142] The Immigration Division has the same constitutional mandate as well as \\nan overarching duty to  give effect to “a legislative initiative purporting to provide a \\nwhole scheme  . . .  for the administration and review of proceedings in  . . .  \\nimmigration” ( Peiroo, at p. 262; see also Reza v. Canada  (1992), 11 O.R. (3d) 65 \\n(C.A.), at p. 80). Mr. Chhin a is attempting to ignore the body explicitly and \\nexclusively tasked with carrying out the purposes of IRPA by wrapping his \\nimmigration detention with a Charter ribbon. \\n[143] This Court in Reza rejected the applicant’s similar attempt to bypass the \\nimmigration scheme in search of a favourable constitutional disposition. In so doing, \\nwe acknowledged that the expertise of the Immigration Division in immigration \\nmatters extends to the constitutional aspects of immigration matters. As La Forest J. \\nwrote in Cuddy Chicks Ltd. v. Ontario (Labour Relations Board), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 5: \\nIt must be emphasized that the process of Charter decision making is not \\nconfined to abstract ruminations on constitutional theory. In the case of \\nCharter matters which arise in a particular r egulatory context, the ability \\nof the decision maker to analyze competing policy concerns is critical . . .  \\n \\n \\n. . . \\n \\nIt is apparent, then, that an expert tribunal . . . can bring its specialized \\nexpertise to bear in a very functional and productive way in the \\ndetermination of Charter issues which make demands on such expertise. \\n[pp. 18-19] \\n[144] Despite Mr. Reza’s attempt to recast his challenge as a constitutional one, \\nthe Court recognized that his Charter arguments were fundamentally grounded in \\nimmigration pol icy. The same is true of Mr. Chhina’s Charter complaints, which \\narose in relation to the Immigration Division’s decisions to continue his detention. \\nThese are matters which lie at the heart of immigration policy. The Immigration \\nDivision is the most approp riate forum to integrate Charter rights within the overall \\nscheme and purposes of IRPA. \\n[145] Properly interpreted, it is clear from the preceding review that the IRPA \\nscheme for the review of immigration detention offers a remedy to detainees that is at \\nleast a s broad, and no less advantageous than review by way of habeas corpus . It \\nprovides for the fullest possible review of the merits of a challenge to immigration \\ndetention. And where an individual is subject to an immigration detention that is said \\nto violate his or her ss. 7, 9 and 12 Charter rights, the Immigration Division’s review \\nprocess, guided by s. 58 of IRPA and s. 248 of the Regulations, allows for at least the \\nsame substantive assessment as that undertaken by superior courts on habeas corpus \\nreview. \\n \\n[146] This Court has repeatedly affirmed that habeas corpus will not lie if the \\nstatutory alternative provides a remedy that is at least as favourable. In my respectful \\nview, it does. Mr. Chhina’s case is therefore captured by the Peiroo exception to the \\navailability of habeas corpus review. The superior court properly declined to exercise \\nits habeas corpus jurisdiction in favour of the complete, comprehensive and expert \\nscheme to which Mr. Chhina was entitled under the Act. \\n[147] I would allow the appeal. \\n \\n Appeal dismissed, ABELLA J. dissenting. \\n Solicitor for the appellants: Attorney General of Canada, Vancouver. \\n Solicitors for the respondent : Nota Bene Law, Calgary; Jackman, \\nNazami & Associates, Toronto; Laishley Reed, Toronto. \\n Solicitors for the intervener End Immigration Detention Network: Sekhar \\nLaw Office, Toronto; Maija Martin, Toronto. \\n Solicitors for the intervener Canadian Association of Refugee \\nLawyers: Jared Will & Associates, Toronto. \\n \\n Solicitors for the intervener Defence for Children \\nInternational-Canada: Wilson, Christen, Toronto. \\n Solicitors for the intervener Amnesty International Canada (English \\nBranch): Community Legal Services-Ottawa, Ottawa; University of Ottawa, Ottawa. \\n Solicitors for the intervener Community & Legal Aid Services \\nProgramme: York University, Osgoode Hall Law School, Toronto. \\n Solicitors for the intervener Canadian Council for Refugees : Edelmann \\n& Company Law Corporation, Vancouver. \\n Solicitors for the intervener Queen ’s Pr ison Law Clinic : Stockwoods, \\nToronto; Queen’s Prison Law Clinic, Toronto. \\n Solicitors for the intervener Egale Canada Human Rights Trusts: Battista \\nSmith Migration Law Group, Toronto. \\n Solicitors for the intervener British Columbi a Civil Liberties \\nAssociation: Frances Mahon Law, Vancouver. \\n Solicitors for th e intervener Canadian Civil Liberties \\nAssociation: Borden Ladner Gervais, Toronto. \\n \\n Solicitors for the intervener Ca nadian Prison Law Association : Borys \\nLaw, Kingston; McCarten Wallace, Toronto. \\n'},\n",

And the Court pointed out tha~: whatever \\nthose cffects might be, the competence of WHO to deal with \\nthem is not dependent on the legality of the acts that caused \\nthem. The Court further pointed out that international organi- \\nzations do not, unlike States, possess a general compe- \\ntence, but are governed by the \"principle of speciality\", \\nthat is to say, they are invested by the States which create \\nthem with powers, the limits of which are a fundon of the \\ncommon interests whose promotion those States entrust to \\nthem. Besides, the World Health Organization is an inter- \\nnational organization of a particular kind-+ \"specialized \\nagency\" forming part of a system based in the Charter of \\nthe United Nations, which is designed to organize interna- \\ntional cooperation in a coherent fashion by bringing the \\nUnited Nations, invested with powers of general scope, \\ninto relationship with various autonomous and comple- \\nmentary organizations, invested with sectorial powers. The \\nCourt therefore concluded that the responsibilities of WHO \\nare necessarily restricted to the sphere of public \"health\" \\nand cannot encroach on the responsibilities of other parts \\nof the United Nations system, and that there is no doubt \\nthat questions concerning the use of force, the regulation \\nof armaments and disarmament are within the competence \\nof the United Nations and lie outside that of the specialized \\nagencies. The request for an advisory opinion submitted by \\nWHO thus does not relate to a question which arises \\n\"within the scope of [the] activities\" of that Organization. \\nThe Court was composed as follows: President Bedjaoui, \\nVice-President Schwebel; Judges Oda, Guillaume, \\nShahabuddeen, Weeramantry, Ranjeva, Herczegh, Shi, \\nFleischhauer, Koroma, Vereshchetin, Ferrari Bravo, Higgins; \\nRegistrar Valencia-Ospina. \\nJudges Ranjeva and Ferrari Bravo appended declarations \\nto the advisory opinion of the Court; Judge Oda appended \\na separate opinion; Judges Shahabuddeen, Weeramantry \\nand Koroma appended dissenting opinions. \\nSubmission of the request and subsequent procedure \\n(paras. 1-9) \\nThe Court begins by recalling that by a letter dated \\n27 August 1993, filed in the Registry on 3 September 1993, \\nthe Director-General of the World Health Organization of- \\nficially communicated to the Registrar a decision taken by \\nthe World Health Assembly to submit a question to the \\nContinued on next page \\nSummaries of Judgments, Advisory Opinions and Orders of the International Court of Justice\\nlution WHA46.40, adopted by the Assembly on 14 May \\n1993, reads as follows: \\n\"In view of the health and environmental effects, would \\nthe use of nuclear weapons by a State in war or other \\narmed conflict be a breach of its obligations under inter- \\nnational law including the WHO Constitution?\" \\nThe Court then recapitulates the various stages of the \\nproceedings. \\nJurisdiction of the Court \\n(paras. 10-3 1) \\nThe Court begins by observing that, in view of Article 65, \\nparagraph 1, of its Statute and of Article 96, paragraph 2, \\nof the Charter, three conditions must be satisfied in order \\nto found the jurisdiction of the Court when a request for \\nan advisory opinion is submitted to it by a specialized \\nagency: the agency requesting the opinion must be duly \\nauthorized, under the Charter, to request opinions from the \\nCourt; the opinion requested must be on a legal question; \\nand this question must be one arising within the scope of \\nthe activities of the requesting agency. \\nAuthorization of WHO to request advisory opinions \\n(paras. 1 1 - 12) \\nWhere WHO is concerned, the above-mentioned texts \\nare reflected in article 76 of that Organization\\'s Constitu- \\ntion, and in paragraph 2 of-article X of the agreement of \\n10 July 1948 between the United Nations and WHO, which \\nthe Court finds leave no doubt that WHO has been duly \\nauthorized, in accordance with Article 96, paragraph 2, of \\nthe Charter, to request advisory opinions of the Court. \\n\\'Zegal question \" \\n(paras. 13-1 7) \\nThe Court observes that it has already had occasion to \\nindicate that questions \\n\"framed in terms of law and rais[ing] problems of inter- \\nnational law . . . are by their very nature susceptible of a \\nreply based on law . . . [and] appear. . . to be questions \\nof a legal character\" (Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, \\nI.C.J. Reports 1975, p. 18, para. 15). \\nIt finds that the question put to the Court by the World \\nHealth Assembly does in fact constitute a legal question, \\nas in order to rule on the question submitted to it the Court \\nmust identify the obligations of States under the rules of \\nlaw invoked, and assess whether the behaviour in question \\nconforms to those obligations, thus giving an answer to the \\nquestion posed based on law. \\nThe fact that this question also has political aspects, as, \\nin the nature of things, is the case with so many questions \\nwhich arise in international life, does not suffice to deprive \\nit of its character as a \"legal question\" and to \"deprive the \\nCourt of a competence expressly conferred on it by its Stat- \\nute\". Nor are the political nature of the motives which may \\nbe said to have inspired the request or the political impli- \\ncations that the opinion given might have of relevance in \\nthe establishment of the Court\\'s jurisdiction to give such \\nan opinion. \\nQuestion arising \"within the scope of the activities \" of \\nWhTO \\n(paras. 18-3 1) \\nThe Court observes that in order to delineate the field \\nof activity or the area of competence of an international \\norganization, one must refer to the relevant rules of the \\norganization and, in the first place, to its constitution. From \\na formal standpoint, the constituent instruments of interna- \\ntional organizations are multilateral treaties, to which the \\nwell-established rules of treaty interpretation apply. But \\nthey are also treaties of a particular type; their object is to \\ncreate new subjects of law endowed with a certain autonomy, \\nto which the parties entrust the task of realizing common \\ngoals. Such treaties can raise specific problems of interpre- \\ntation owing, inter alia, to their character which is conven- \\ntional and at the same time institutional; the very nature of \\nthe organization created, the objectives which have been \\nassigned to it by its founders and the imperatives asso- \\nciated with the effective performance of its functions, as \\nwell as its own practice, are all elements which may de- \\nserve special attention when the time comes to interpret \\nthese constituent treaties. \\nAccording to the customary rule of interpretation as \\nexpressed in article 3 1 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on \\nthe Law of Treaties, the terms of a treaty must be inter- \\npreted \"in their context and in the light of its object and \\npurpose\" and there shall be \\n\"taken into account, together with the context: \\n(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the \\ntreaty which establishes the agreement. of the parties \\nregarding its interpretation\". \\nThe Court has had occasion to apply this rule of interpre- \\ntation several times and will also apply it in this case. \\nInterpretation of the WHO Constitution \\n(paras. 20-26) \\nThe: Court points out that the functions attributed to WHO \\nare listed in 22 subparagraphs (subparagraphs (a) to (v)) in \\narticle 2 of its Constitution. None of these subparagraphs \\nexpressly refers to the legality of any activity hazardous to \\nhealth; and none of the functions of WHO is dependent \\nupon the legality of the situations upon which it must act. \\nMoreover, it is stated in the introductory sentence of article 2 \\nthat the Organization discharges its functions \"in order to \\nachieve its objective\". The objective of the Organization \\nis dei\\'lned in article 1 as being \"the attainment by all \\npeoples of the highest possible level of health\". \\nAlso referring to the preamble to the Constitution, the \\nCourt concludes that, interpreted in accordance with their \\nordinary meaning, in their context and in the light of the \\nobject and purpose of the WHO Constitution, as well as of \\nthe practice followed by the Organization, the provisions \\nof its article 2 may be read as authorizing the Organization \\nto deal with the effects on health of the use of nuclear \\nweapons, or of any other hazardous activity, and to take \\npreventive measures aimed at protecting the health of \\npopulations in the event of such weapons being used or \\nsuch activities engaged in. \\nIt goes on to observe that the question put to the Court \\nin the present case relates, however, not to the effects of \\nthe use of nuclear weapons on health, but to the legality of \\nthose effects might be, the competence of WHO to deal \\nwith them is not dependent on the legality of the acts that \\ncaused them. Accordingly, it does not seem to the Court \\nthat the provisions of article 2 of the WHO Constitution, \\ninterpreted in accordance with the criteria referred to \\nabove, can be understoocl as conferring upon the Organi- \\nzation a competence to address the legality of the use of \\nnuclear weapons, and thus in turn a competerlce to ask the \\nCourt about that. \\nI11 the view of the Court, none of the func1:ions referred \\nto in the resolution by which the Court has been seised of \\nthis request for an opiniorl has a sufficient corinection with \\nthe question before it for that question to be capable of \\nbeing considered as arising \"within the scope of [the] activi- \\nties\" of WHO. The causes of the deterioration of human \\nhealth are numerous and varied; and the legal or illegal \\ncharacter of thcse causes is essentially immaterial to the \\nmeasures which WHO must in any case take in an attempt \\nto remedy their effects. In particular, the legality or illegality \\nof the use of nuclear weilpons in no way determines the \\nspecific measures, regarding health or otherwise (studies, \\nplans, procedures, etc.), which could be necesary in order \\nto scek to prcvent or cure some of their effects. \\'The reference \\nin the question put to the Court to the health and environ- \\nmer~tal effects, which according to WHO the use of a \\nnuc\\'lear weapon will always occasion, does not make the \\nquestion one that falls within WHO\\'S functions. \\nThe Court goes on to point out that international organi- \\nzations are subjects of international law which do not, \\nunlike States, possess a general competence. International \\norganizations are governed by the \"principle of special- \\nity\", that is to say, they are invested by the States which \\ncreate them with powers, t.he limits of which are a function \\nof the common interests whose promotion those States \\nentrust to them. \\nThe powers conferred on international organizations are \\nnonnally the subject of an express statement in their con- \\nstitu.ent instruments. Nevertheless, the necessi.ties of inter- \\nnational life may point to the need for organizations, in \\norder to achieve their objectives, to possess subsidiary \\npowers which are not expressly provided for in the basic \\ninstruments that govern their activities. It is generally ac- \\ncepted that international organizations can exercise such \\npowers, known as \"implied\" powers. \\nThe Court is of the opinion, however, that to ascribe to \\nWHO the competence to address the legality of the use of \\nnuclear weapons-even in view of their health and envi- \\nronmental effects-would be tantamount to disregarding \\nthe principle of speciality;, for such competence could not \\nbe deemed a necessary in~plication of the Constitution of \\nthe Organization in the light of the purposes assigned to it \\nby i-ts member States. \\nWHO is, moreover, an international orgar~ization of a \\nparticular kind. As indicated in the preamble and con- \\nfirmed by article 69 of its Constitution, \"the Organization \\nshall be brought into relation with the Uniteti Nations as \\none of the specialized agencies referred to in Article 57 of \\nthe Charter of the United Nations\". As its Articles 57, 58 \\nand 63 demonstrate, the Charter laid the basis of a \"sys- \\ntem\" designed to organize international cooperation in a \\ncoherent fashion by bringing the United Nations, invested \\nwith powers of general scope, into relationship with vari- \\nous autonomous and complementary organ:izations, in- \\nvested with sectorial powers. \\nIf, according to the rules on which that system is based, \\nWHO has, by virtue of Article 57 of the Charter, \"wide \\ninternational responsibilities\", those responsibilities are \\nnecessarily restricted to the sphere of public \"health\" and \\ncannot encroach on the responsibilities of other parts of the \\nUnited Nations system. And there is no doubt that ques- \\ntions concerning the use of force, the regulation of arma- \\nments and disarmament are within the competence of the \\nUnited Nations and lie outside that of the specialized \\nagencies. \\nFor all these reasons, the Court considers that the ques- \\ntion raised in the request for an advisory opinion submitted \\nto it by WHO does not arise \"within the scope of [the] \\nactivities\" of that Organization as defined by its Consti- \\ntution. \\nWHO\\'S practice \\n(para. 27) \\nA consideration of the practice of WHO bears out \\nthese conclusions. None of the reports and resolutions \\nreferred to in the preamble to World Health Assembly reso- \\nlution WHA46.40, nor resolution WHA46.40 itself, could \\nbe taken to express, or to amount on its own to, a practice \\nestablishing an agreement between the members of the \\nOrganization to interpret its Constitution as empowering it \\nto address the question of the legality of the use of nuclear \\nweapons, nor can, in the view of the Court, such a practice \\nbe inferred from isolated passages of certain resolutions \\nof the World Health Assembly cited during the present \\nproceedings. \\nThe Court further considers that the insertion.of the \\nwords \"including the WHO Constitution\" in the question \\nput to the Court does not change the fact that WHO is not \\nempowered to seek an opinion on the interpretation of its \\nConstitution in relation to matters outside the scope of its \\nfunctions. \\nOther argunrents \\n(paras. 29-30) \\nThe Court finally considered that other arguments put \\nforward in the proceedings to found the jurisdiction of the \\nCourt--concerning the way in which World Health Assem- \\nbly resolution WHA46.40 had been adopted and concern- \\ning the reference to that resolution in General Assembly \\nresolution 49/75 K-did not affect the conclusions reached \\nby the Court concerning the competence of WHO to re- \\nquest an opinion on the question raised. \\nHaving arrived at the view that the request for an advi- \\nsory opinion submitted by WHO does not relate to a ques- \\ntion which arises \"within the scope of [the] activities\" of \\nthat Organization in accordance with Article 96, paragraph 2, \\nof the Charter, the Court finds that an essential condition \\nof founding its jurisdiction in the present case is absent and \\nthat it cannot, accordingly, give the opinion requested. \\nThe final paragraph reads as follows: \\n\"32. For these reasons, \\nTHE COURT, \\ni3y eleven votes to three, \\nFinds that it is not able to give the advisory opinion \\nwhich was requested of it under World Health Assembly \\nSchwebel; Judges Oda, Guillaume, Ranjeva, Herczegh, \\nShi, Fleischhauer, Vereshchetin, Ferrari Bravo, Higgins; \\nAGAINST: Judges Shahabuddeen, Weeramantry, \\nKoroma. \" \\nDeclaration of Judge Ranjeva \\nJudge Ranjeva voted in favour of the decision of the \\nCourt as he considers that it accords with the relevant law. \\nHe would none the less have preferred the Court to be more \\nexplicit with respect to the problem of its advisory juris- \\ndiction, by stressing the fact that the structure of the ques- \\ntion put by the World Health Assembly had not been such \\nas to enable it to exercise the jurisdiction that it did, in any \\ncase, possess. \\nDeclaration of Judge Ferrari Bravo \\nJudge Ferrari Bravo regrets that the Court should have \\narbitrarily divided into two categories the long line of Gen- \\neral Assembly resolutions that deal with nuclear weapons. \\nThose resolutions are fundamental. This is the case of reso- \\nlution 1 (I) of 24 January 1946, which clearly points to the \\nexistence of a truly solemn undertaking to eliminate all \\nforms of nuclear weapons, whose presence in military \\narsenals was declared unlawful. The cold war, which inter- \\nvened shortly afterwards, prevented the development of \\nthis concept of illegality, while giving rise to the concept \\nof nuclear deterrence which has no legal value. The theory \\nof deterrence, while it has occasioned a practice of the \\nnuclear-weapon States and their allies, has not been able \\nto create a legal practice serving as a basis for the incipient \\ncreation of an international custom. It has, moreover, \\nhelped to widen the gap between Article 2, paragraph 4, of \\nthe Charter and Article 5 1. \\nThe Court should have proceeded to a constructive \\nanalysis of the role of the General Assembly resolutions. \\nThese have, from the outset, contributed to the formation \\nof a rule prohibiting nuclear weapons. The theory of deter- \\nrence has arrested the development of that rule and, while \\nit has prevented the implementation of the prohibition of \\nnuclear weapons, it is none the less still the case that that \\n\"bare\" prohibition has remained unchanged and continues \\nto produce its effects, at least with regard to the burden of \\nproof, by making it more difficult for the nuclear Powers \\nto vindicate their policies within the framework of the \\ntheory of deterrence. \\nSeparate opinion of Judge Oda \\nJudge Oda, while being in agreement with the Court\\'s \\ndecision that the request should be dismissed as well as \\nwith the reasoning leading to that decision, nevertheless \\nwishes to make clear his view that the Court should have \\ntaken more note of the fact that it was asked not only \\nwhether the use of nuclear weapons would be a breach of \\nthe obligations of States under international law but \\nwhether it would also be a breach of the obligations of \\nStates under the WHO Constitution. \\nJudge Oda is very concerned that the Court may be \\nseised of more requests for advisory opinion which may in \\nessence be unnecessary and oversimplistic. He stressed that \\nthe advisory function should only be used in cases of con- \\nflict or dispute and not merely to discuss general matters \\nof international law. \\nHe also pointed out that advisory opinions had been \\nrequested by specialized agencies in three previous cases \\nin the history of the Court, but strictly in order to solve one \\nor more legal questions arising within the scope of their \\nactivities. This precedent has not been followed in the pres- \\nent case. \\nJudge Oda points out that the request of WHO was \\ndrafted without there being any real agreement among the \\ndelegates in the World Health Assembly and, in particular, \\nthat it was brought to the Court contrary to the repeated \\nadmonitions of the Legal Counsel of WHO, who contended \\nthat the Organization was not competent to bring this \\nmatter to the Court under Article 96 (2) of the Charter of \\nthe United Nations. \\nDissenting opinion of Judge Shahabuddeen \\nThc: main reason for Judge Shahabuddeen\\'s dissent is \\nthat, in his respectful view, the Court has mistaken the \\nmeaning of WHO\\'S question. Contrary to the Court\\'s im- \\npression, WHO is not asking whether the use of nuclear \\nweapons by one of its members is lawful under interna- \\ntional law as a general matter; a more reasonable interpre- \\ntation of the question is that WHO is asking whether such \\nuse would be a breach of a member\\'s obligations under \\ninternational law but only in so far as it would also be a \\nbreach of its obligations under the Constitution of WHO. \\nWHO would have to deal with the health and environ- \\nmental effects produced by the action of a member even if \\nthat action is in breach of the member\\'s obligations under \\nthat Constitution; but it nevertheless remains competent for \\nWHO to concern itself with the question whether, in pro- \\nducing a situation demanding action by WHO, a member \\nmay have breached its obligations under that Constitution. \\nDissenting opinion of Judge Weeramantry \\nJudge Weeramantry, in his dissenting opinion, stated \\nthat the question asked by the World Health Organization \\nrelated to obligations in three particular areas: \\n(a) State obligations in regard to health; \\n(b) State obligations in regard to the environment; and \\n(c) State obligations under the WHO Constitution. \\nThe question asked by WHO was substantially different \\nfrom the general question of legality of use or threat of use \\nof nuclear weapons, asked by the General Assembly. \\nHowever, the Court had treated it as a question of general \\nillegality, and had not examined State obligations in the \\nthree areas mentioned. \\nHad the Court inquired into these three areas, it would \\nhave found that each of them was intimately linked with \\nthe legitimate concerns of WHO and that, in each of these \\nareas, State obligations were violated by nuclear weapons. \\nJudge Weeramantry, in his opinion, examines the health- \\nrelated and environmentally related effects of nuclear \\nweapons to show the diametrical contrast between those \\neffects and the obligations of States, both as members of \\nthe international community, in general, and as subscribing \\nparties to the WHO Constitution. \\nJudge Weeramantry strongly disagreed with the majority \\nof the Court, who had held that WHO3 question was out- \\nside the scope of its legitimate sphere of interest. His view, \\non the other hand, was that the question asked by WHO \\nwas entirely within its legitimate and constitutional sphere \\nnuclear weapon, which was the greatest man-made threat \\nto human health thus far devised. \\nWHO was the only health authority to which the world \\nwould have to turn for international assistance if a country \\nwere stricken with a nuclear attack, for its own health services \\nwould have collapsed. !vloreover, even neutral countries \\nnor involved in the dispute, which would be affected by the \\nradiation and other effect.s of nuclear weapons, would need \\nto turn to WHO for assistance in such a:n eventuality. \\nGlobal health was central to the question, just as global \\nhealth was central to the concerns of WHO. \\n:planning and prevention were essential ports of the ac- \\ntivities of all health authorities, and this general principle \\nunquestionably applied to WHO, which needs the legal \\ninformation requested, for precisely this purpose. \\n\\'The Court\\'s decision was based on restricted principles \\nof treaty interpretation and should rather have interpreted \\nW1-10\\'s Constitution in the light of its object and pur- \\npose-\"to promote and protect the health 01\\' all peoples\". \\nJudge Weeramantry disagreed with the view that United \\nNations agencies conducted their affairs within a strictly \\ncoinpartmentalized sche~me of division of functions. He \\ndisagreed with the Cou~t\\'s rigid application of the \"prin- \\nciple of speciality\" to \\\\YHO, so as to take the question \\nof legality out of its area of concern, merely because peace \\nant1 security fell withiin the concerns of the Security \\nCouncil. \\n\\'The effects of nuclea~r weapons on health showed the \\nfutility of awaiting a nuclear catastrophe for INHO to move \\ninto action in providing medical services. The nuclear \\nweapon was, inter alia, the greatest cancer-inducing instru- \\nmentality yet devised. WHO was just as mu.ch entitled to \\ncorlcern itself with the legality of this agency of ill health \\nas it was to inquire into the legality of a cancer-inducing \\npharmaceutical product. Depending on the answer to that \\nquestion, it would have to adopt different strategies to deal \\nwith the problem. \\nlvloreover, this was the first case ever in which the \\nCo.urt had refused to consider the request of\\' a specialized \\nagency of the United Nations for an advi:;ory opinion. \\nSuch a refusal should only be for compelling reasons. No \\nsuch reason has been shown to exist in the present case. \\nJuclge Weeramantry\\'s view was that international law \\njoined with the imperatives of global health in requiring \\nthe Court to answer WHO\\'S request. \\nDissenting opinion of Judge Koroma \\nIn his dissenting opinion, Judge Koroma stated that \\nthe Court\\'s finding that it lacked jurisdiction to respond to \\nthe request by WHO was not only unprecedented but also \\ninconsistent with its own jurisprudence. \\nHe also disputed the Court\\'s finding that the question \\nposed by the Organization was outside its competence and \\nscope of activities. To reach that conclusion, Judge Koroma \\nmaintained that the Court had misconstrued the question \\nput by WHO as relating to the legality of the -use by a State \\nof nuclear weapons in a.rmed conflict. In his view, that \\nquestion related to the health and environmental effects of \\nnuclear weapons and to the problem of whether those effects \\nwollld be in breach of the obligations of Stiites, a matter \\nwhiich falls eminently within the competence and scope of \\nthe agency\\'s activities. \\nHe recalled that WHO is the specialized agency respon- \\nsible for the protection and the safeguarding of the health \\nof all peoples at the international level and its responsibili- \\nties include the taking of measures to prevent health prob- \\nlems like those which are bound to arise following the use \\nof nuclear weapons. In this connection, he pointed out that \\nthe Organization dealt primarily with preventive medicine. \\nAccordingly, in his view, a request to the Court seeking \\nlegal clarification about the health and environmental ef- \\nfects of the use of nuclear weapons not only is a matter \\nwhich is within the competence of the Organization but is \\none which should have led the Court to render an advisory \\nopinion. \\nJudge Koroma recalled that the Court had previously \\nstated that it would: \\n\"give an opinion based on law, once it has come to the \\nconclusion that the questions put to it are relevant and \\nhave a practical and contemporary effect, and conse- \\nquently . . . not devoid of object and purpose\". \\nHe maintained that the request for an advisory opinion \\nby WHO related to an issue which not only was of direct \\nrelevance to the Organization, but had practical and con- \\ntemporary effect as well, and is not devoid of object and \\npurpose. \\nHaving analysed the evidence presented by delegations \\nincluding those of Japan and the Marshall Islands, and the \\nstudy carried out under the auspices of WHO on the Effects \\nof Nuclear War on Health and Health Services, he came \\nto the conclusion that should a nuclear weapon be used \\nin an armed conflict the number of dead would vary from \\none million to one thousand million, to which the same \\nnumber of people injured was to be added. If a larger \\nnumber of such weapons were to be used, they would have \\ncatastrophic effects, including the destruction of transport, \\nfood delivery, fuel and basic medical supplies, resulting in \\npossible famine and mass starvation on a global scale. He \\nconcluded that nuclear weapons when used are incapable \\nof discriminating between civilians and non-civilians, nor \\nwould such weapons spare the hospitals or reservoirs of \\ndrinking water that are indispensable for survival after a \\nnuclear attack. He was therefore convinced that nuclear \\nweapons caused superfluous injury and unnecessary suffer- \\ning to their victims, going so far as to prevent the treatment \\nof those wounded. \\nSuch effects, he maintained, would be patently contrary \\nto international law applicable in armed conflict, and in \\nparticular international humanitarian law, as well as con- \\nstituting a breach of the health and environmental obliga- \\ntions of States under international law, including the WHO \\nConstitution. The Court\\'s findings that such matters were \\nnot within the competence or scope of activities of the \\nOrganization were therefore incoherent and incomprehen- \\nsible. \\nJudge Koroma regretted that, in order to reach those \\nfindings, the Court not only had misinterpreted the ques- \\ntion-a misinterpretation which both distorted the inten- \\ntion of the questioa and proved fatal for the request-but \\nhad also had to depart from its jurisprudence according to \\nwhich it would only decline to render an advisory opinion \\nfor \"compelling reasons\". In his view, no such compelling \\nreasons existed or had been established in this case. He was \\ntherefore left wondering whether the finding of the Court \\nthat it lacked jurisdiction was not the kind of solution \\nresorted to in cases where the need to give a decision on \\nresponded positively to requests for advisory opinions and \\nregarded its role as a form of participation in the activities \\nof the Organization, while at the same time protecting its \\njudicial character. By declining to render an opinion in this \\ncase the Court had, in his view, chosen to vacate its posi- \\ntive record in this sphere, particularly on an issue of such \\nvital importance that embraced not only a legal but a moral \\nand humanitarian dimension as well. He concluded by \\nrecall.ing that \"medicine is one of the pillars of peace\", but \\nthat it can equally be said that health is a pillar of peace- \\nor, as is stated in the WHO Constitution, \"the health of all \\npeoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and \\n'},\n",

A Memorial by Spain and a \\nCounter-Memorial by Canada on the question of the \\njurisdiction of the Court were duly filed within the time \\nlimits prescribed by an Order of the President of 2 May \\n1995. \\nAfter Spain had expressed the wish to be authorized to \\nsubmit a Reply and Canada had opposed that request, the \\nCourt, by an Order of 8 May 1996, decided that it was \\nsufficiently informed, and that the preseiltation by the \\nParties of further written pleadings on the question of the \\nCourt\\'s jurisdiction therefore did not appear necessary. \\nPublic hearings were held between 9 and 17 June 1998. \\nIn the Application, the following requests werc made by \\nSpain: \\n\"As for the precise nature of the conlplaint, the \\nKingdom of Spain requests: \\n(A) that the Court declare that the legislation of \\nCanada, insofar as it claims to exercise a jurisdiction \\nover ships flying a foreign flag on the high seas. outside \\nthe exclusive economic zone of Canada, is not opposable \\nto the Kingdoin of Spain; \\n* * (B) that the Court adjudge and declare that Canada \\nis bound to refrain froin any repetition of the acts \\nRei.ic.n* yj\\'thr yr,oceedii~g.s aid suhntission.r of the coinplained of, and to offer to the Kingdom of Spain the \\nPrri-ties reparation that is due, in the for111 of an indemnity the \\n(paras. 1-12) amount of which must cover all the damages and injuries \\noccasioned; and The Court begins by recalling that on 28 March 1995, (C) that, consequently, the Court declare also that Spain iostituted proceedings against Canada in respect of a the boarding on the high seas. on March 11)95, of the disp~~tc relating to the amendment, on 12 May 1994, of the ship Estni flying the flag of Spain and the measures of Canadian Coastal Fisheri.es Protection Act, and the coercion and the exercise of jurisdiction over that ship silI>sequent amendn~ents tc~ the regulations implementing and over its captain constitute a concrete violation of the that Act. as well as to specific actions taken on the basis of \\nSummaries of Judgments, Advisory Opinions and Orders of the International Court of Justice\\nlaw.\" \\nIn the oral proceedings, the following submissions were \\npresented by the Parties: \\n011 behalf of the Spanis11 Governittent, at the sitting of 15 \\nJune 1998: \\n\"At the end of our oral arguments, we again note that \\nCanada has abandoned its allegation that the dispute \\nbetween itself and Spain has become moot. At least, it \\nappears to have understood that it cannot be asserted that \\nthe Spanish Application, having no further purpose for \\nthe future, merely amounted to a request for a \\ndeclaratory judgment. Nor does it say - a fact of which \\nwe take note - that the agreement between the \\nEuropean Union and Canada has extinguished the \\npresent dispute. \\nSpain\\'s final submissions are therefore as follows: \\nWe noted at the outset that the subject matter of the \\ndispute is Canada\\'s lack of title to act on the high seas \\nagainst vessels flying the Spanish flag, the fact that \\nCanadian fisheries legislation cannot be invoked against \\nSpain, and reparation for the wrongful acts perpetrated \\nagainst Spanish vessels. These matters are not included \\nin Canada\\'s reservation to the jurisdiction of the Court. \\nWe also noted that Canada cannot claim to \\nsubordinate the application of its reservatioii to the sole \\ncriterion of its national legislation and its own appraisal \\nwithout disregarding your competence, under Article 36, \\nparagraph 6, of the Statute, to determine your own \\njurisdiction. \\nLastly, we noted that the use of force in arresting the \\nEstai and in harassing other Spanish vessels on the high \\nseas, as well as the use of force contemplated in \\nCanadian Bills C-29 and C-8, can also not be included in \\nthe Canadian reservation, because it contravenes the \\nprovisions of the Charter. \\nFor all the above reasons, we ask the Court to \\nadjudge and declare that it has jurisdiction in this case.\" \\nOn behalf of the Canadicrn Government, at the sitting of \\n17 June 1998: \\n\"May it please the Court to adjudge and declare that \\nthe Court has no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the \\nApplication filed by Spain on 28 March 1995.\" \\nBackground to the case \\n(paras. 13-22) \\nThe Court begins with an account of the background to \\nthe case. \\nOn 10 May 1994 Canada deposited with the Secretary- \\nGeneral of the United Nations a new declaration of \\nacceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. \\nCanada\\'s prior declaration of 10 September 1985 had \\nalready contained the three reservations set forth in \\nsubparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 2 of the new \\ndeclaration. Subparagraph (4 of the 1994 declaration, \\nhowever, set out a new, fourth reservation, further excluding \\nfrom the jurisdiction of the Court \"(4 disputes arising out of \\nor concerning conservation and management measures \\ntaken by Canada with respect to vessels fishing in the \\nNAFO Regulatory Area, as defined in the Convention on \\nFuture Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic \\nFisheries, 1978, and the enforcement of such measures.\" \\nOn the same day that the Canadian Government \\ndeposited its new declaration, it submitted to Parliament Bill \\nC-29 amending the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act by \\nextending its area of application to include the Regulatory \\nArea of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization \\n(NAFO). Bill C-29 was adopted by Parliament, arid received \\nthe Royal Assent on 12 May 1994. The Coastal Fisheries \\nProtection Regulations were also amended, on 25 May \\n1994, and again on 3 March 1995. when Spanish and \\nPort~~guese fishing vessels were taken up in Table IV of \\nSection 21 (the category of fishing vessels which were \\nprohibited from fishing for Greenland halibut in the area \\nconcerned). \\nOn 12 May 1994, following the adoption of Bill C-8, \\nCanada also amended Section 25 of its Criminal Code \\nrelating to the use of force by police officers and other peace \\nofficers enforcing the law. This Section applied as well to \\nfisheries protection officers. \\nOn 9 March 1995, the Estai, a fishing vessel flying the \\nSpanish flag and manned by a Spanish crew, was \\nintercepted and boarded some 245 iliiles from the Canadian \\ncoast, in Division 3L of the NAFO Regulatory Area (Grand \\nBanks area), by Canadian Government vessels. The vessel \\nwas seized and its master arrested on charges of violations \\nof the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act and its implementing \\nregulations. They were brought to the Canadian port of St. \\nJohn\\'s, Newfoundland, where they were charged with \\noffences under the above legislation, and in particular illegal \\nfishing of Greenland halibut; part of the ship\\'s catch was \\nconfiscated. The members of the crew were released \\nimmediately. The master was released on 12 March 1995, \\nfollowing the payment of bail, and the vessel on 15 March \\n1995, following the posting of a bond. \\nThe same day that the Estui was boarded, the Spanish \\nEmbassy in Canada sent two Notes Verbales to the \\nCanadian Department of Foreign Affairs and international \\nTrade. The second of these stated inter alia that: \"the \\nSpanish Government categorically condemn[ed] the pursuit \\nand harassment of a Spanish vessel by vessels of the \\nCanadian navy, in flagrant violation of the international law \\nin force, since these acts [took] place outside the 200-mile \\nzone\". \\nI11 its turn, on 10 March 1995 the Canadian Department \\nof Foreign Affairs and International Trade sent a Note \\nVerbale to the Spanish Embassy in Canada, in which it was \\nstated that \"[tlhe Estai resisted the efforts to board her made \\nby Canadian inspectors in accordance with international \\npractice\" and that \"the arrest of the Estai was necessary in \\norder to put a stop to the overfishing of Greenland halibut \\nby Spanish fishermen\". \\nA.lso on 10 March 1995, the European Cominunity and \\nwliich protested against the Canadian action. \\nOn 16 April 1995, an \"Agreement constituted in tlie \\nform of an Agreed Minute, an Exchange of Letters, an \\nExchzmge of Notes and the Annexes thereto between the \\nEuropean Community and Canada on fisheries in tlie \\ncontext of the NAFO Convention\" was i1iil:ialled; this \\nAgreement was signed in Brussels on 20 April 1995. It \\nconcerned tlie establish men^ of a Protocol to strengthen the \\nNAFO Consel-vation and Enforcement Measures\"; the \\nimmediate implcinentation 011 a provisional basis, of certain \\ncontrol and enforcement measures; the total allowable catch \\nfor 1995 for Greenland halibut within the area concer~ied; \\nand c:ertain management a:rrangemeiits for stocks of this \\nfish. \\nThe Agreed Minutes further provided as follows: \"The \\nEuropean Coiiiinunity and Canada niaintaiii their respective \\npositisons on the conformity of the amendment of 25 May \\n1994 to Canada\\'s Coastal Fisheries Protection Act, and \\nsubsequent regulations, wii:li customary internatioiial law \\nand the NAFO Convention. Nothing in this Agreed Minute \\nshall prejudice any nlu1tila:teral convention to which the \\nEuropean Community and Canada, or any Member State of \\nthe European Comniunity and Canada, are parties, or their \\nability to preserve and defend their rights in conformity with \\ninternational law, and the views of either Party with respect \\nto any question relating to the Law of tlie Sea.\" The \\nEuropean Community emphasized that the stay of \\nprose1:ution against the vessel Estai and its master was \\nessential for the application of the Agreed Minute. \\n011 18 April 1995 the proceedings against the Estui and \\nits master were discontinu.ed by order of tha Attorney- \\nGeneral of Canada; on 19 April 1995 the bond was \\ndischarged and the bail was repaid with interest; and \\nsubsequently the confiscated portion of the catch was \\nreturned. On 1 May 1995 tlie Coastal Fis1ierie.s Protection \\nRegul.ations were amendecl so as to remove Spain and \\nPortugal from Table IV to Section 21. Finally, the Proposal \\nfor Itriproving Fisheries Control and Enforcement. contained \\nin the Agreement of 20 April 1995, was adopted by NAFO \\nat its annual meeting held in September 1995 and became \\nnieasilres binding on all Corltracting Parties with effect from \\n29 November 1995. \\nThe strbject of the dispirte \\n(paras. 23-35) \\nNeither of the Parties d,:nies that there exists a dispute \\nbetween them. Each Party, however, characterizes the \\ndispute differently. Spain has characterized the dispute as \\none relating to Canada\\'s lack of entitlement to exercise \\njurisdiction on the high seas, and the non-opposability of its \\namended Coastal Fisheries Protection legislation and \\nregulations to third States, including Spain. Spain further \\nmaintains that Canada, by its conduct, has violated Spain\\'s \\nrights under internatioilal law and that such viol~~tion entitles \\nit to reparation. Canada states that the dispute concerns the \\nadoption of ineasurcs for the conservation and inanagenient \\nof fisheries stocks with respect to vessels fishing in the \\nNAFO Regulatory Area and their enforcement. \\nSpain insists that it is free, as the Applicant in this case, \\nto characterize the dispute that it wishes the Court to \\nresolve. \\nThe Court begins by observing that there is no doubt that \\nit is for the Applicant, in its Application, to present to the \\nCourt the dispute with which it wishes to seize tlie Court \\nand to set out the claims which it is submitting to it. \\nParagraph 1 of Article 40 of the Statute of the Court requires \\ninoreover that the \"subject of the dispute\" be indicated in \\nthe Application; and, for its part, paragraph 2 of Article 38 \\nof the Rules of Court requires \"the precise nature of the \\nclaim\" to be specified in the Application. In a number of \\ninstances in the past the Court has had occasion to refer to \\nthese provisions. It has characterized the111 as \"essential \\nfroin the point of view of legal security and the good \\nadministration of justice\". \\nIn order to identify its task in my proceedings instituted \\nby one State against another, the Couirt must begin by \\nexamining the Application. However, it niay happen that \\nuncertainties or disagreements arise with regard to the real \\nsubject of the dispute with which the Court has been seized, \\nor to the exact nature of the claims submitted to it. In such \\ncases the Court cannot be restricted to a consideration of the \\nterms of the Application alone nor, more generally. can it \\nregard itself as bound by the claims of the Applicant. \\nIt is for the Court itself, while giving particular attention \\nto the formulation of the dispute chose11 by the Applicant, to \\ndetermine on an objective basis the dispute dividing the \\nparties, by examining the position of both Parties. It will \\nbase itself not only on the Application and ha1 \\nsubmissions, but on diplomatic exchanges, public \\nstatements and other pertinent evidence. \\nIn order to decide on the preliminary issue of jurisdiction \\nwhich arises in the present case, the Court will ascertain the \\ndispute between Spain and Canada, taking accouiit of \\nSpain\\'s Application, as well as the various written and oral \\npleadings placed before the Court by the Parties. \\nThe filing of the Application was occasioned by specific \\nacts of Canada wliich Spain contends violated its rights \\nunder international law. These acts were carried out on the \\nbasis of certain enactments and regulations adopted by \\nCanada, which Spain regards as contrary to international \\nlaw and not opposable to it. It is in that context that the \\nlegislative enactments and regulations of Canada should be \\nconsidered. The specific acts which gave rise to the present \\ndispute are the Canadian activities on the high seas in \\nrelation to the pursuit of tlie Estui, the ineans used to \\naccomplish its arrest and the fact of its arrest, aiid the \\ndetention of the vessel and arrest of its master, arising froin \\nCanada\\'s amended Coastal Fisheries Protection Act aiid \\niinplenienting regulations. The essence of the dispute \\nbetween the Parties is whether these acts violated Spain\\'s \\nrights under international law and require reparation. The \\nCourt must now decide whether the Parties have conferred \\n(paras. 36-84) \\n\"It is said that Spain argues for the most r.estrictise \\nscope pertr~itted of reservations, namely a restrictive \\ninterpretation of them ... This is not true. Spain supports As Spain sees it, Canada has in principle accepted the tlie most limited scope permitted in the coiltext of jurisdiction of the Court through its declaration under observing of the general rule of interpretation laid down Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute, and it is for Canada in Article 31 of tlie Vienna Convention on the Law of to show that the reservation contained in paragraph 2 (4 Treaties.\" thereto does exempt the dispute between the Parties from \\nthis jurisdiction.

Although a party seeking to assert a fact must Court,s jurisdiction must be interpreted so as to be in bear the burden of proving it, this has no relevance for the conformity with. rather than contrary to. the Statute of the establishment of the Court\\'s jurisdiction, which is a Charter of United Nations and general \"question of law to be resolved in the light of the relevant international law.

On 21 April 1995 \\nCanada informed the Court, by letter, that in its view the \\nCourt lacked jurisdiction to entertain the Application \\nbecause the dispute was within the plain terms of the \\nreservation in paragraph 2 (4 of the Canadian declaration of \\n10 May 1994. This position was elaborated in its Counter- \\nMemorial of February 1996, and confirmed at the hearings. \\nFrom the arguments brought forward by Spain the Court \\nconcludes that Spain contends that the interpretation of \\nparagraph 2 (4 of its declaration sought for by Canada \\nwould not only be an anti-statutory interpretation, but also \\nan anti-Charter interpretation and an anti-general \\ninternational law interpretation, and thus should not be \\naccepted. The issue for the Court is consequently to \\ndetermine whether the meaning to be accorded to the \\nCanadian reservation allows the Court to declare that it has \\njurisdiction to adjudicate upon the dispute brought before it \\nby Spain\\'s Application. \\nDifferent views were proffered by the Parties as to the \\nrules of international law applicable to the interpretation of \\nreservations to optional declarations made under Article 36, \\nparagraph 2, of the Statute. In Spain\\'s view, such \\nreservations were not to be interpreted so as to allow \\nreserving States to undermine the system of coinpulsoiy \\njurisdiction. Moreover, the principle of effectiveness meant \\nthat a resenration must be interpreted by reference to the \\nobject and purpose of the declaration. which was the \\nacceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. \\nSpain did not accept that it was making the argument that \\nreservations to the compuilsory jurisdiction of the Court \\nshould be interpreted restrictively; it explained its position \\nin this respect in the following terms: \\nway, in context and with particular regard for the intention \\nof the reserving State. \\nThe Court recalls that the interpretation of declarations \\nmade under Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute, and of \\nany reservations they contain, is directed to establishing \\nwhether mutual consent has been given to the jurisdiction of \\nthe Court. It is for each State, in formulating its declaration, \\nto decide upon the limits it places upoil its acceptance of the \\njuristliction of the Court: \"This jurisdiction only exists \\nwithin the limits within which it has been accepted\". \\nConditions or reservations thus do not by their terins \\nderogate from a wider acceptance already given. Rather, \\nthey operate to define the parameters of the State\\'s \\nacceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. \\nThere is thus no reason to interpret theill restrictively. This \\nis tme even when, as in the present case, the relevant \\nexpression of a State\\'s consent to the Court\\'s jurisdiction, \\nand the limits to that consent, represent a inodification of an \\nearlier expression of consent, given within wider limits; it is \\nthe d.eclaration in existence that alone constitutes the unity \\nto be interpreted, with the same I-ules of interpretation \\napplicable to all its provisions, including those containing \\nreservations. \\nThe regime relating to the interpretation of declarations \\nmade: under Article 36 of the Statute which are unilateral \\nacts of State sovereignty, is not identical with that \\nestablished for the interpretation of treaties by the Vienna \\nConvention on the Law of Treaties. In the event, the Court \\nhas in earlier cases elaborated the appropriate rules for the \\ninterpretation of declarations and reservations. \\nIn accordance with those rules the Court will interpret \\nthe relevant words of a declaration including a reservation \\ncontained therein in a natural and reasonable way, having \\ndue regard to the intention of the State concerned at the time \\nwhen it accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. \\nThe intention of a reserving State inay be deduced not only \\nfrom the text of the relevant clause, but also from the \\npreparation and tlie purposes intended to be served. In the \\npresent case tlie Court has such explanatioiis in 1.1ie form of \\nCanadian ministerial statements, parliamentary debates. \\nlegislative proposals and press commuiiiquCs. \\nIt follows from the foregoiiig analysis that the contra \\nyrofererttenz rule has no role to play in this case in \\ninterpreting the reservatiorl contained in the unilateral \\ndeclaration niade by Canada under Article 36, paragraph 2. \\nof the Statute. \\nThe Court was also addressed by both Parties on the \\nprinciple of effectiveness. C\\'ertainly, this principle has an \\nimporl:aiit role in the law of treaties and in the jurisprudence \\nof this Court: however, what is required in the first place for \\na reservation to a declaration niade under .4rticle 36, \\nparagraph 2, of the Statute, is that it should be interpreted in \\na 1nan:ner compatible with the effect sought by the reserving \\nState. \\nSpain has contended that, in case of doubt, reservations \\ncoiitai.ned in declarations arc; to be interpreted consistently \\nwith legality and that any interpretation which is \\ninconsistent with the Statute of tlie Court, the Charter of the \\nUnited Nations or with general international law is \\ninadmissible. Spaiii argues that, to coiiiply with these \\nprecepts, it is necessary to interpret the phras.2 \"disputes \\narising out of or conceniing conservation and rrlanagement \\nmeasures taken by Canada with respect to vessels fishing in \\nthe NAFO Regulatory Area ... and tlie enforcement of such \\nmeasures\" to refer only to measures which, since they relate \\nto areas of the high seas, must come within tlie framework \\nof an existing international agreement or be directed at \\nstateless vessels. It further argues that an eiifcrccment of \\nsuch ineasures which involves a recourse to force on the \\nhigh seas against vessels flying flags of other States could \\nnot be consistent wit11 interr~atioiial law atid thal: this factor \\ntoo requires an interpretation of the reservation different \\nfrom that given to it by Canada. \\nThe Court observes that Spain\\'s positioil is not in \\nconformity with the principle of interpretation whereby a \\nreservation to a declaration of acceptance of tlie conipulsory \\njurisdi.ction of the Court is to be interpreted in a natural and \\nreasonable way, with appropriate regard for tlie i~tentioiis of \\nthe reserving State aiid the purpose of the res~:rvation. In \\npoint of fact, reservations from the Court\\'s juristliction may \\nbe made by States for a variety of reasons; soinetiines \\nprecisely because they feel vulnerable about the: legality of \\ntheir position or policy. Nowhere in the Court\\'s case-law \\nhas it been suggested that interpretation in acco!-dance with \\ntlie legality under inteimational law of the matters exempted \\nfrom the jurisdiction of the Court is a rule that governs the \\ninterpretation of such reservations. There is a fundaniental \\ndistinction between the acceptance by a State of the Court\\'s \\njurisdiction and tlie compatibility of particular acts with \\ninternational law. The former requires consent. The latter \\nquestion can only be reached when the Court deals with the \\nmerits, after having established its jurisdiction and having \\nheard full legal argument by both parties. Whether or not \\nStates accept the jurisdiction of tlie Court, they raiiiain in all \\ncases responsible for acts attributable to them that violate \\nthe rights of other States. Any resultant disputes are required \\nto be resolved by peacefill means, the choice of which, \\npursuant to Article 33 of the Charter, is left to the parties. \\nSul,pai-agruph (d) ofpu~.agrayh 2 of Cunuda :r \\ndecluration of 10 May 1994 \\n(paras. 57-84) \\nIn order to determine whether the Parties have accorded \\nto the Court jurisdiction over the dispute brought before it, \\nthe Court must now interpret subparagraph (6) of paragraph \\n3 of Canada\\'s declaration, having regard to the rules of \\ninterpretation which it has just set out. \\nBefore commencing its examination of the text of the \\nreservation itself, the Court observes that the new \\ndeclaration differs from its predecessor in one respect only: \\nthe addition, to paragraph 2, of a subparagraph (4 \\ncontaining the reservation in question. It follows that this \\nreservation is not only an integral part of the current \\ndeclaration but also an essential component of it, and hence \\nof the acceptance by Canada of the Court\\'s compulsory \\njurisdiction. \\nThe Court further notes, in view of the facts as \\nsummarized above, the close links between Canada\\'s new \\ndeclaration and its new coastal fisheries protection \\nlegislation, as well as the fact that it is evident from the \\nparliamentary debates and the various statements of the \\nCanadian authorities that the purpose of the new declaration \\nwas to prevent the Court from exercising its jurisdiction \\nover niatters which inight arise with regard to the \\ninternational legality of the amended legislation and its \\nimplementation. \\nThe Court recalls that subparagraph 2 (4 of the \\nCanadian declaration excludes the Court\\'s jurisdiction in the \\nfollowing terms: \\n\"disputes arising out of or concerning conservation and \\nmanagement measures taken by Canada with respect to \\nvessels fishing in the NAFO Regulatory Area, as defined \\nin the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in \\nthe Northwest Atlantic Fisheries, 1978, and the \\nenforcement of such measures\". \\nCanada contends that the dispute submitted to the Court \\nis precisely of the kind envisaged by the cited text; it falls \\nentirely within the terms of tlie subparagraph and the Court \\naccordingly has no jurisdiction to entertain it. For Spain, on \\nthe other hand, whatever Canada\\'s intentions, they were not \\nachieved by the words of the reservation, which does not \\ncover the dispute; thus the Court has jurisdiction. In support \\nof this view Spain relies on four main arguments: first, the \\ndispute which it has brought before the Court falls outside \\nthe terms of the Canadian reservation by reason of its \\nsubject matter; secondly, the amended Coastal Fisheries \\nProtection Act and its implementing regulations cannot, in \\ninternational law, co~lstitute \"conservation and management \\nmeasures\"; thirdly, the reservation covers only \"vessels\" \\nwhich are stateless or flying a flag of convenience; and \\nof ...\" conservation and management \"measures\". The Court pure and simple. \\nexanlines each of these arguments in turn. Canada, by contrast, stresses the very wide meaning of \\nthe word \"measure\". It takes the view that this is a \"generic \\nMeaning of the teiein \"disputes arisirtg out of or term\", which is used in international conventions to \\ncorlcentiitg \" encornpass statutes, regulations and administrative action. \\n(paras. 62-63) Canada further argues that the expression \"conservation and \\nThe Court begins by pointing out that, in excluding from \\nits jurisdiction \"disputes wising out of or coitcerrling\" the \\nconsel-vation and management measures in question and \\ntheir enforcement, the reservation does not reduce the \\ncriterion for exclusion to the \"subject matter\" of the dispute. \\nThe words of the reservation - \"disptrtes arising out oj\\'or \\ncollcerning\" - exclude not only disputes whose immediate \\n\"subject matter\" is the measures in question and their \\nenforcement. but also those \"conceritirtg\" such measures \\nand, more generally, those having their \"origin\" in those \\nineasures (\"ar-ising out of\\') - that is to say, those disputes \\nwhich, in the absence of such measures, would not have \\ncome into being. \\nThe Court has already found, in the present case, that a \\ndispute does exist between the Parties, and it has identified \\nthat dispute. It must now determine whether that dispute has \\nas its subject matter the measures mentioned in the \\nreservation or their enforcement. or both, or concerns those \\nmeasures, or arises out of them. In order to do this, the \\nfundatnental question which the Court must now decide is \\nthe meaning to be given to the expression \"conse~~~ation and \\nInnnagentent nteasures ...\" and \"e~tforceineitt of\\' sztch \\nmeaszwes\" in the context of the reservation. \\nMeailing of \"coizservation artd ntnitngente~tt ineastlres \" \\n(paras. 64-73) \\nSpain recognizes that the tenn \"niec~sure\" is \"an abstract \\nword signifying an act or provision, a dkmarche or the \\ncourse of an action, conceived with a precise aim in view\" \\nand that in consequence, in its most general sense, the \\nexpression \"con.sei?mtiorz and nlnnagenzmzt iileasure\" must \\nbe understood as referring to an act, step or proceeding \\ndesigned for the purpose of the \"conservation and \\nmanagement of fish\". However, in Spain\\'s view this \\nexpression, in the particular context of the Canadian \\nreservation, must be interpreted more restrictively. Spain\\'s \\nmain argument, on which it relied throughout the \\nproceedings, is that the term \"conservation and management \\nmeasures\" must be interpreted here in accordance with \\ninternational law and that in consequence it must, in \\nparticular, exclude any unilateral \"measure\" by a State \\nwhich adversely affected the rights of other States outside \\nthat State\\'s own area of jurisdiction. Hence, in international \\nlaw only two types of measures taken by a coastal State \\ncould, in practice, be regarded as \"conservation and \\nmanagement measures\": those relating to the State\\'s \\nexclusive economic zone; and those relating to areas outside \\nthat zone, insofar as these came within the framework of an \\ninternational agreement or were directed at stateless vessels. \\nMeasures not satisfying these conditions were not \\nmanagement measures\" is \"descriptive\" and not \\n\"nomnative\"; it covers \"the whole range of ineasures taken \\nby States with respect to the living resources of the sea\". \\nTlie Court points out that it need not linger over the \\nquestion whether a \"measure\" may be of a \"legislative\" \\nnature. As the Parties have theinselves agreed, in its \\nordinary sense the word is wide enough to cover any act, \\nstep or proceeding, and imposes no particular liinit on their \\nmaterial content or on the aim pursued thereby. Nunierous \\ninternational conventions include \"laws\" among the \\n\"mea!;ures\" to which they refer. The Court further points out \\nthat, in the legislative system as in that of many \\nother countries, a statute and its iinplementing regulations \\ncannot be dissociated. The statute establishes the general \\nlegal framework and the regulations permit the application \\nof the statute to meet the variable and changing \\ncircurnstances through a period of time. The regulations \\nimplementing the statute can have no legal existence \\nindependently of that statute, while conversely the statute \\nmay require implementing regulations to give it effect. \\nThe Court shares with Spain the view that an \\ninternational instrument must be interpreted by reference to \\ninternational law. However, in arguing that the expression \\n\"conservation and management measures\" as used in the \\nCanadian reservation can apply only to measures \"in \\nconformity with international law\", Spain would appear to \\nmix two issues. It is one thing to seek to determine whether \\na concept is known to a systein of law, in this case \\niliternational law, whether it falls within the categories \\nproper to that system and whether, within that system, a \\nparticular meaning attaches to it: the question of the \\nexistence and content of the concept within the systenl is a \\nmatter of definition. It is quite another matter to seek to \\ndetermine whether a specific act falling within the scope of \\na concept known to a system of law violates the normative \\nrules of that system: the question of the conformity of the \\nact with the systein is a question of legality. \\nAccording to international law, in order for a measure to \\nbe characterized as a \"conservation and management \\ntneasure\", it is sufficient that its purpose is to conserve and \\ninanage living resources and that, to this end, it satisfies \\nvarious technical requirements. It is in this sense that the \\nterms \"conservation and management measures\" have long \\nbeen understood by States in the treaties which they \\nconclilde. The same usage is to be found in the practice of \\nStates. Typically, in their enactments and adnlinistrative \\nacts, States describe such measures by reference to factual \\nand scientific criteria. \\nReading the words of the reservation in a \"natural and \\nreasonable\" manner, there is nothing which permits the \\nsense different from that generally accepted in internatioilal \\nlaw and practice. Moreover, imy other interpretation of that \\nexpression would deprive the reservation of its intended \\neffect. \\nAfter an examination of the amendments made by \\nCanada on 12 May 1994 to tlie Coastal Fisheries Protection \\nAct an\\'d on 25 May 1994 and 3 March 1995 to the Coastal \\nFisheries Protection Regu1at:ions tlie Court conc:ludes that \\nthe \"m~easures\" taken by Canada in amending its coastal \\nfisherits protection legislatioil and regulations constitute \\n\"conservation and management measures\" in the sense in \\nwhich that expression is commonly understood in \\ninternational law and practice and has been used in the \\nCanadian reservation. \\nMeaning to be attributed to the word \"vessels\" \\n(paras. 74-77) \\nThe Court goes on to observe that the conservation and \\nmanagement measures to which this reservation refers are \\nnieasures \"taken by Caitada with respect to vessels -fislziizg \\niil the IVAFO Regrl(itor?, Arecz, crs defiled in the (?oitventiorr \\non Future Multilc1tei~uI Cooperatioi~ ii~ the NOJ-thwest \\nAtlantic Fisheries, 1978\". As the NAFO \"Regulatory Area\" \\nas defined in the Convention is indisputably part of the high \\nseas, t\\'he only reniaiiiing issue posed by this part of the \\nreserva.tion is the meaning to be attributed to the word \\n\"vesse1.s\". Spain argues that it is clear from the \\nparlianientary debates which preceded the adoption of Bill \\nC-29 that the latter was intended to apply only i;o stateless \\nvessels. or to vessels flying a flag of convenience. It \\nfollowed, according to Spain. - in view of the close links \\nbetween the Act and the reservation - that the latter also \\ncovered only measures taker1 against such vessels. Canada \\naccepts that, when Bill C-29 was being debated, there were \\na numiber of references to stateless vessels and to vessels \\nflying flags of convenience, for at the time such vessels \\nposed .the most iiiimediate threat to the conservation of the \\nstocks that it sought to protect. However, Canada denies that \\nits i1itc:ntion was to restrict the scope of the Act and the \\nreservation to these categories of vessels. \\nThe Court observes that the Canadian reservation refers \\nto \"vessels fishing ...\", that is to say all vessels fishing in the \\narea in question. without exception. It would clearly have \\nbeen simple enough for Canada. if this had been its real \\nintention, to qualify tlie word \"vessels\" so as to restrict its \\nmeaniiig in the context of the reservation. In the opinion of \\nthe Court the interpretation proposed by Spain cannot be \\naccepted, for it runs contirary to a clear text, which, \\nmoreover, appears to express the intention of its author. \\nNeither can the Court share the conclusions drawn by Spain \\nfrom tlie parliamentary debates cited by it. \\nMeaning aizd scope of the phi-use \"uitd the erlforceinent \\nof suclz nzeaszrres \" \\n(paras. 78-84) \\nThe Court then examines the phrase \"and the \\neiforcemeizt of szrclt riteasui-es\", on the meaning and scope \\nof which the Parties disagree. Spain contends that an \\nexercise of jurisdiction by Canada over a Spanish vessel on \\nthe high seas entailing the use of force falls outside of \\nCanada\\'s reservation to the Court\\'s jurisdiction. \\nThe Court notes that, following the adoption of Bill C- \\n29, the provisions of the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act \\nare of a character and type to be found in legislation of \\nvarious nations dealing with fisheries conservation and \\nmanagement, as well as in Article 22 (1) @ of the United \\nNations Agreement on Straddling Stocks of 1995. The \\nlimitations on the use of force specified in the Coastal \\nFisheries Protection Regulations Amendment of May 1994 \\nalso bring the authorized use of force within the category \\nfamiliar in connection with enforcement of conservation \\nmeasures. The Court further notes that the purpose of other \\nCanadian enactments referred to by Spain appears to have \\nbeen to control and limit any authorized use of force, thus \\nbringing it within the general category of nieasures in \\nenforcement of fisheries conservation. \\nFor all of these reasons the Court finds that the use of \\nforce authorized by the Canadian legislation and regulations \\nfalls within the ambit of what is commonly understood as \\nenforcement of conservation and management measures and \\nthus falls under the provisions of paragraph 2 (4 of \\nCanada\\'s declaration. This is so notwithstanding that the \\nreservation does not in terms mention the use of force. \\nBoarding, inspection, arrest and minimum use of force for \\nthose purposes are all contained within the concept of \\nenforcement of conservation and management measures \\naccording to a \"natural and reasonable\" interpretation of this \\nconcept. \\nThe Court concludes by stating that in its view, the \\ndispute between the Parties, as it has been identified in this \\nJudgment, had its origin in the amendments made by \\nCanada to its coastal fisheries protection legislation and \\nregulations and in the pursuit, boarding and seizure of the \\nEstcri which resulted therefrom. Equally, the Court has no \\ndoubt that the said dispute is very largely concerned with \\nthese facts. Having regard to the legal characterization \\nplaced by the Court upon those facts, it concludes that the \\ndispute submitted to it by Spain constitutes a dispute \\n\"arising out of\\' and \"concerning\" \"conservation and \\nmanagement measures taken by Canada with respect to \\nvessels fishing in the NAFO Regulatory Area\" and \"the \\nenforcement of such measures\". It follows that this dispute \\ncoines within the terms of the reservation contained in \\nparagraph 2 (4 of the Canadian declaration of 10 May \\n1994. The Court consequently has no jurisdiction to \\nPresident Schwebel, in a separate opinion, held tliat, \\ncontrary to Spain\\'s argument, a reservation to a declaration \\nunder the optional clause is not ineffective insofar as it \\nexcludes actions by the declarant State that are illegal under \\ninternational law. A very purpose of a reservation may be to \\ndebar the Court from passing upon legally questionable \\nactions. \\nNor does Canada\\'s reservation embody a self-judging \\nproviso in violation of the authority of the Court to \\ndetermine its jurisdiction. \\nSpanish counsel argued that Canada\\'s reservation as \\ninterpreted by Canada is \"a nullity\" and that it \"excludes \\nnothing, since it can apply to nothing\". While not accepting \\nthis argument, President Schwebel concluded that if, \\narguendo, these contentions of Spain are correct, it follows \\nthat tlie nullity or ineffectiveness of tlie reservation entails \\ntlie nullity of the declaration as a whole. The Canadian \\nreservation is an essential element of the declaration, but for \\nwhich the declaration would not have been made. When, as \\nin this case, the reservation has been treated by the declarant \\nas such an essential one, the Court is not free to hold the \\nreservation invalid or ineffective while treating the \\nremainder of the declaration to be in force. If the Spanish \\nargument on the results to be attached to Canada\\'s \\ninterpretation of the reservation is accepted, there is no basis \\nwhatever in this case for the jurisdictioli of the Court. \\nSepui-ate opinion of Judge Oda \\nJudge Oda fully concurs with the operative part of the \\nJudgment. \\nJudge Oda nonetheless considers it appropriate, lest the \\nreal issues in the case should be buried in obscurity, to spell \\nout what issues existed in the dispute between Canada and \\nSpain. \\nHe considers that the subject of the \"dispute\" in the \\npresent case relates to the Estai incident. In his view, \\nCanada\\'s legislative enactments in 199411995 are to be \\nexamined, but oidy in the context of that incident. The Estui \\nincident occurred in the \"Regulatory Area\" of the 1979 \\nNAFO Convention, which area lies beyond the exclusive \\neconomic zone where the coastal States exercise fisheries \\njurisdiction. Judge Oda makes it plain that, within the \\nframework of the NAFO Convention, the adoption of \\nmeasures of conservation and management of fishery \\nresources in the Regulatory Area is the ~esponsibility of the \\nNAFO Fisheries Commission, but not of any particular \\ncoastal State. He has stressed that the whole chain of events \\nregarding the Estai incident unfolded irrespective of the \\nNAFO Convention. \\nJudge Oda thus suggests that the only issue in dispute \\nwas whether Canada violated the rule of international law \\nby clainiing and exercising fisheries jurisdiction on the high \\nseas, or whether Canada was justified, irrespective of the \\nNAFO Convention, in exercising fisheries jurisdiction in an \\narea of the high seas on the ground of its honestly held \\nurgently required as a result of tlie fishery conservation \\ncrisis in the Northwest Atlantic. \\nJudge Oda is of the opinion, however, that the sole \\nquestion to be decided by the Court at tlie present stage of \\nthe case is whether the dispute falls within the purview of \\nthe clause whereby Canada declared its acceptance of the \\nCoW:\\'s jurisdiction on 10 May 1994. \\nHe considers it to be clear, given the basic principle that \\nthe Court\\'s jurisdiction is based on the consent of sovereign \\nState!;, that a declaration to accept tlie conipulsory \\njurisdiction of the Court under Article 36. paragraph 2. of \\nthe Statute. and any reservations attached thereto, must, \\nbecause of the declaration\\'s unilateral character, be \\ninterpreted not only in a natural way and in context, but rilso \\nwith particular regard for the intention of tlie declarant \\nState. Any interpretation of a respondei~t State\\'s declaration \\nagainst the intention of that State will contradict the ve~y \\nnature of the Court\\'s jurisdiction, because tlie declaration is \\nan instrument drafted unilaterally. \\nHe further states that tlie fact that Canada made its \\ndeclaration containing the reservation set out in paragraph 2 \\n(4 only a few days prior to enacting tlie amendtnents to its \\nfisheries legislation clearly indicates the true i~itention of \\nCanada in respect of those amendments and of any disputc \\nwhich might arise as a result of their implementation. \\nJudge Oda is at a loss to understand why the Court \\nshould have felt it necessary to devote so much time to its \\ninterpretation of the wording of that reservation. After \\nmaking an analysis of the development of tlie law of tlie sea, \\nparticularly as it concerns marine living resources, Judge \\nOda notes that there exists no fixed or concrete concept of \\n\"conservation and management tnerrslrt-es\". \\nIt is clear to Judge Oda tliat Canada, having reserved \\nfrom the Court\\'s jurisdiction any \"disputes arising out of or \\nconcerning conservation and management nieasures\", had in \\nmind - in a very broad sense and without restriction and \\nshowing great common sense - any dispute which niight \\narise :Following the enactment and enforcement of legislation \\nconcerning fishing, whether for the purpose of conservation \\nof stocks or for management of fisheries (allocation of \\ncatches), in its offshore areas, whether within its exclusive \\neconomic zone or outside it. \\nJudge Oda points out that no diplomatic negotiations \\ntook :place between Spain and Canada with regard to the \\nenactment in 1994 and 1995 of Canada\\'s national legislation \\nor its amendment, and that there was no further diplonlatic \\nnegotiation between the two countries over the Estrii \\nincident. He notes that after the conclusion on 20 April 1995 \\nof the Agreement between the EC and Canada, tlie dispute \\narising out of the Estui incident was practically solved. \\nJudge Oda suggests that the dispute could have bee11 solved \\nif negotiations between Spain and Canada had been held. \\nissue of whether a legal dispute may be submitted \\nuiiilaterally to the Court oiily after diplomatic negotiations \\nbetwcen the disputing par tic:^ have becn exhausted or at \\nleast initiated. He submits, however, that it could have been \\nquestioned, even at this jurisdictional stage - separately \\nfrom the issue of whether the Court has jurisdiction to \\nentertain Spain\\'s Application - whether Spain\\'s \\nApplication of 28 March 1995 in the present case was really \\n~~/riiissible to the Coui3 at all. \\nSeparate opinioil of Judge Kororna \\nIn his separate opinion, Judge Koroina emphasized the \\nabsolute and unfettered freedom of a State to pal-ticipate or \\nnot to participate in the optional clause system. As a \\ncorollary, he confirmed that a State is entitled to a.ttach to its \\ndeclara.tion made under the optional clause a I-eservation \\nexcluding or limiting the Court\\'s jurisdiction to apply the \\nprinciples and rules of international law which the Court \\nwould have applied. had .the subject matter not been \\nexcluded from the jurisdiction of the Court. \\nIn Judge Koroma\\'s view, flowing from first principles, \\nonce it is established that a dispute falls within tb.e category \\nof the subject matter defined or excluded in a reservation, \\nthen that dispute is precluded from the jurisdici:ion of the \\nCourt, whatever the scope of the rules w\\'hich have \\npurportedly been violated. He agreed with the Court\\'s \\nfinding that, once it had determined that the measures of \\ncoliselvation and management referred to in the I-eservation \\ncontained in the Canadian declaration were measures of a \\nkind which could be categorized as conservation and \\nmanagement of the resources of the sea, and were consistent \\nwith customary norms and well-established practice, then \\nthe Court was bound to decline to found jurisdic:iion on the \\nbasis of tlie priiiciples which have been invoked. \\nJudge Koroma pointed out that it is in this sense that he \\nunderstands the statement in the Judgment that \"the \\nlawful~iess of the acts whicli a reservation to a declaration \\nseeks to exclude from tlie jurisdiction of the Cc,urt has no \\nrelevance for the iiiterpretation of the terms of that \\nreservation\". \\nIn other words, the Court\\'s jurisdiction to adjudicate in a \\ndispute derives fiom the Statute and the consent of a State as \\nexpressed in its declaration arid not from the applicable law. \\nIn the judge\\'s view, what was determinative in this \\nmatter was whether Canada had made a declaration under \\ntlie optional clause, whether that declaration excluded \\ndisputr:~ arising out of or concerning conservation and \\ntnaliagelnent measures and whether the acts complained of \\nfall within the category of the excluded acts. The Court in \\nrespon.ding affirmatively to those questions, not only \\nreached the right decision but affirmed that its compulsory \\njurisdiction is based 011 the previous consent o:F the State \\nconcerned and subject to the limits of that consent. \\nAc~:ordingly, and flowing from the above principles, \\nsince Canada had excluded fiom the jurisdiction of the \\nCourt \"disputes arising out of or concerning conservation \\nand management measures\", the questioil whether the Court \\nwas entitled to exercise its jurisdictioii must depend on the \\nsubject matter whicli had beell excluded and not on the \\napplicable laws or on the rules which were said to have been \\nviolated. \\nFinally, Judge Koroma eiilphasized that this Judgment \\nshould not be viewed as an abdication of tlie Court\\'s judicial \\nfunction to pronounce on the validity of a declaration and its \\nreseivation, but rather should be seen as a reaffirniation of \\nthe principle that the character of a declaration makes it \\nnecessary for the Court to determine tlie scope and content \\nof the consent of a declarant State. The Court reserves its \\ninherent right to decide that a reseivation has been invoked \\nin bad faith, and to reject the view of the State in question. \\nSeparate opinion of Judge Kooiji~iai~s \\nJudge Kooijmans concurs with the Coui-t\\'s finding that it \\nhas no jurisdiction to entertain the dispute submitted by \\nSpain. He cast his vote, however, with a heavy heart since \\nthe Court\\'s Judgment bears testimony to the inherent \\nweakness of the optional clause system. The making of \\nreservations by a State to its declaration of acceptance of the \\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the Court under Article 36, \\nparagraph 2 of the Statute has never been coiitroversial \\n(with the exception of reservations which are contrary to the \\nStatute itself). The Court, therefore, has to apply the law as \\nit stands. \\nIn the present case Canada has submitted a new \\ndeclaration in whicli it added a reservation in order to \\nprevent the Court from scrutinizing the legality of an action \\nit intended to undertake. According to present internatiolial \\nlaw Canada was fully entitled to do so. Nevertheless, it \\nseems to be a legitimate question how far a State can go in \\naccepting the compulsory jurisdiction of tlie Court, thereby \\nexpressing its conviction that adjudicatioli is the most \\nappropriate method to settle a wide range of conceivable but \\nnot imminent legal disputes, at the same time exempting \\nfroin the Court\\'s jurisdiction all anticipated and therefore \\nimminent dispute. According to Judge Kooijmans it would \\nnot have been beyond the Court\\'s mandate to draw attention \\nto the risks to which the optional clause systenl is exposed \\nsince this system is an integral and essential element of the \\nStatute of which the Court is the guardian. In this context \\nJudge Kooijmans draws attention to the fact that \\ncompulsory adjudicatioii is niore than a matter of procedure \\nbut that it also touches upon the substance of tlie law. States \\nwho know that they can be brought to court will inevitably \\nbe more inclined to see tlie law in terms of how they think a \\ncourt would apply it. \\nDissenting opii1ioil of Mce-President Weeranzrriitly \\nVice-President Weeramantly, in his dissenting opinion, \\nobserves that there is no question of the invalidity of tlie \\nCanadian reservation. The reservation is a valid one which \\nCanada was well entitled to make. The Court\\'s task is to \\ninterpret this valid reservation. Would this reseivation cover \\ninternational law, including violation of the freedom of the \\nhigh seas, the unilateral use of force by Canada, and \\ninfringements of Spain\\'s sovereignty over its vessels at sea? \\nVice-President Weerainantry\\'s view is that it is a matter \\nfor the Court\\'s discretion as to whether such matters fall \\nwithin the general part of the declaration (which gives the \\nCourt jurisdiction over all disputes arising after the \\ndeclaration), or under the reservation relating to \\nconservation measures. Where violations of basic principles \\nof international law, extending even to violation of Charter \\nprinciples are alleged, Vice-President Weeramantry is of the \\nview that the dispute falls within the general referral rather \\nthan the particular exception. It seems unreasonable that the \\nmere fact that such acts originated in conservation measures \\nshould preserve them from Court scrutiny even when they \\nhave extended so far beyond the reach of the reservations \\nclause as to enter the area of violations of basic principles of \\ninternational law. \\nOptional clause jurisdiction represents a haven of \\nlegality within the international system and, while States \\nhave unfettered autonomy to decide whether to enter the \\nsystem, once they do so they are bound by its rules and by \\nthe basic principles of international law which prevail \\ntherein. It is not possible to contract out of the applicability \\nof the latter, once a State has opted to enter the system. \\nThe Spanish allegations are as yet unproved, and a \\npreliminary objection to jurisdiction can succeed only if the \\nCourt would still lack jurisdiction, even assuming that all \\nthe alleged circumstances will eveiltually be proved. In \\nVice-President Weeramantry\\'s view, the Court cannot so \\nhold, as some of the circumstances alleged would, if proved, \\ngive jurisdiction to the Court under the general part of the \\ndeclaration. The objection raised by Canada is therefore not \\nof an exclusively preliminary character. \\nVice-President Weeramantry also examines the \\nhistorical origins of the optional clause with a view to \\nstressing the difficulty with which the limited jurisdiction of \\nthe Court was achieved. The expectation at the time of the \\ncreation of this jurisdictioil was that it would develop with \\nuse. An unduly narrow interpretation of the clause, when \\nother interpretations are reasonably available within the \\nframework of the declaration considered as a whole, would \\ncontract rather than develop this jurisdiction. \\nDissenting opiilion of Jz4dge Bedjaoui \\nI. General Iiztroductioii \\nCanada\\'s twice formulated reservations would appear to \\nreflect its hesitation, or reluctance, to submit to the sanction \\nof the International Court issues which it regards as vital, \\nand in relation to which it considers the applicable law to \\nbe, in the words of the Canadian Foreign Minister, \\n\"inadequate, non-existent or irrelevant\". The point was that \\nCanada was not entirely satisfied with the Montego Bay \\nConvention of 10 December 1982 on the Law of the Sea, \\nwhich for this reason it has not ratified and which, in its \\nview, failed to settle filly the problem of overfishing, thus \\njeopardizing fisheries resources for future generations. \\nCanada has frequently expressed its dissatisfaction and \\ninvok:ed the \"emergency\", or \"state of necessity\", which it is \\ncurrently undergoing in this regard. \\nThe Court had to rule on its jurisdiction by examining \\nthe meaning and scope of Canada\\'s reservation, but it was \\nnot entitled to ignore the fact that, if it accepted such a \\nreservation, it was leaving the author of that reservation free \\nto combat foreign overfishing by unilaterally giving itself \\npowers over the Itigh seas for as long as no settlement had \\nbeen reached between itself and the States concerned. This \\naccount of the background to the case was necessary, \\ninasmuch as, where a reservation has been formulated \\nratione inateriae, it cannot prime facie be understood \\nwithout some minimal reference to the substantive issues \\ninvolved. \\nThe case would have been perfectly simple if the duty of \\nthe Court had merely been to ascertain the meaning of the \\nexpression \"conservation and management measures\" \\ncontained in the reservation, and to declare that \"the \\nenforcement of those measures\" against the Spanish fishing \\nvessel Estai was precisely covered by the ternls of that \\nreservation, thus preventing the Court from entertaining any \\nclaim in this regard. The emphasis has to be placed on \\nanother far more important term of the reservation. that \\nwhich places Canada\\'s action, in geographical terms, \"in the \\nNAFO Regulatory Area\", that is to say otrtside the 200-ii~ile \\nliiizit. And indeed the Estai was boarded some 245 miles off \\nthe Canadian coast. \\nThe purpose of the reservation is to signal urbi et orbi \\nthat Canada claims special jurisdiction over the high seas. \\nThe Court cannot interpret or accept this reservation in the \\nsame way as it would interpret or accept an ordinary \\nresenration, since, without any need for a consideration of \\nthe merits, its terms prima facie disclose a violation of a \\nbasic principle of international law. This is an issue which \\nthe Court cannot simply ignore by restricting itself to an \\nexternal and superficial interpretation of the reservation. It \\ncannot be right for the Court to content itself in this case \\nwith a purely formal view of the reservation, disregarding \\nits material content - a content which does not require \\ninvestigation involving an examination of the merits, since \\nit is abundantly clear that the reservation affects a \\ntraditionally established right. This is the real flavour of this \\nfascinating case. \\nThe Court calllot content itself with declaring that the \\nboarding on the high seas of a foreign fishing vessel simply \\nconstitutes enforcement of conservation and management \\nmeaswes taken by Canada, and thus hold that that incident \\nis covered by a reservation entirely depriving it of \\njurisdiction, for this would be to utilize the screen of \\n\"conservation and management measures\", interpreted in an \\nartificial manner, without any regard for what such \\nmeasilres involve in terms of their violation of a well- \\nestablished principle of international law. \\nIt follows that the only proper attitude is to interpret and \\nof nations that a definition of !such measures must be sought. \\nAnd two options, and two only, accordingly present \\nthemselves to the Court at this stage of the proceedings: \\neither, at the very least, to state that it cannot readily find \\nany well-established international definition of such \\nmeasures applicable to the case before it, and that it is \\naccordingly obliged to touch on the merits of the case by \\ngoing fwther in its examination of the facts and of their \\nimplications in terms of the international practice of States, \\nand in consequence to declare that Canada\\'s otjection to \\njurisdiction is not of an excTusively preliminaiy character \\nwithin .the meaning of Article 79, paragraph 7, of\\'the Rules \\nof Court; or, on the other hand, to declare that it does have \\navailable to it an undispute:d international defitlitioil of \\nconservation and management measures, which, applied to \\nthis case, obliges it to interprct the Canadian reservation as \\ninvalid and not opposable to these proceedings insofar as it \\npurports to cover acts occurring on the high seas, and \\naccordingly not capable of constituting a bar to the Court\\'s \\njurisdiction to proceed to an examination of the merits. \\nJudge Bedjaoui has not dealt with all the po:nts which \\nappear to him disputable in the Judgment - it1 particular \\nthe theoretical and practical implications of the methods of \\ninterpretation etnployed therein, or at least the manner in \\nwhich -the Judgment formulates a number of these points \\n(see in particular paragraphs 46 to 54 of the Judgment) - \\nbut has restricted himself to raising three important \\nquestians on which, to his great regret, he finds himself \\nobliged to express his disagreement with the majclrity of the \\nCourt: \\n- the subject matter of the dispute; \\n- the validity of the Canadian resewation; \\n- the definition of coilservatioil and management \\nmeasures. \\n11. The subject nzatter of the dispute \\nWh.at is nnique about the present case and at: the satnc \\ntime gives it its great interest :From the legal point of view, is \\nthe per:sistent disagreement between the applicant State and \\nthe Respondent with regard to the actual subject matter of \\nthe dispute - a disagreement now extended by another, just \\nas far-reaching, between the majority of the Court and the \\nminority on the same point. This is a situation rarely \\nencountered in the Court\\'s jurisprudence. \\nIt is of course the Applicant who has the ini1:iative and \\nwho de:fines - at its own procedural risk - the subject of \\nthe dispute which it wishes to bring before the Court. In this \\nregard it enjoys a clear proc~:dural right, deriving froin its \\nstatus tu Applicant, to seek and to obtain from the Court a \\nruling on the subject of the dispute which it has submitted to \\nit and otz that nlone, to the exclusion of all others (subject. \\nof course, to any incidental proceeding). Spain, as a \\nsowi-eigrz State and as npplicnnt State, en-joyed the \\nundisputed right to bring before the Court - at its own \\nclear pirocedwal risk -. any aspect of the dispute which it \\nconside:red it might legitimately submit, and it had an \\ninalienable legal interest in seeking and obtaining a i-uling \\non the specific dispute whose subject inatter it had clearly \\ndefined. \\nSpain clearly indicated the precise matter on which it \\nwas bringing Canada before the Court. In both its written \\nand its oral pleadings, it consistently complained of \"a very \\nserious infringement of a right deriving from its sovereign \\nstatus, namely exclusive jurisdiction over vessels flying its \\nflag on the high seas\". \\nIt was an altogether difirrent subject matter that \\nCanada - notwithstanding its status as respondei~t Stnte - \\nraised against Spain. It invoked issues of fishing and of the \\nconservation and management of fisheries resources within \\nthe NAFO Regulatory Area, and consequently contended \\nthat this was the true subject of the dispute, which was \\nexcluded froin the jurisdiction of the Couit by virtue of \\nreservation (d) inserted by Canada in its new declaration \\nnotified on 10 May 1994 (two days before the adoption of \\nBill C-29 atnending the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act). \\nThere is of course a connection between the subject \\nmatter of the dispute, as defined by the Applicant for the \\npurposes of the proceedings which it instituted, but \\nregrettably cannot pursue, and the subject matter alleged by \\nthe Respondent to be the true one, now settled and emptied \\nof substance. However, that connection in no way justified \\nthe substitution by the Court of the second subject for the \\nfirst one as defined by the Applicant. \\nThe Court cannot in any sense modify \"the decor\" or \\nchange the subject of the dispute. For, if it did so, it would \\nbe rendering judgment in a case altogether different from \\nthat submitted to it by the Applicant. The Co~wt\\'s role is to \\ngive an appropriate legal chnmcterizatiorz to tltose clain~s \\nof the applicant Stclte which  proper(^^ conze within the \\nji-amework of\\'tlte subject inatter of the dispute as thnt Sttrte \\nAns de$ned it it1 its Application. This does not mean that the \\nCourt has the power to alter the subject matter put before it. \\nStill less can the respondent State propose a different subject \\nmatter to the Court. That would be to hear a djferetzt case. \\nThus, while Spain proclain~s its sovereignty on the high \\nseas over its vessels, Canada speaks of conservation and \\nrnanageinent measures. While Spain invokes a \"conflict of \\njurisdiction\" on the high seas, Canada opposes to it a \\n\"conflict over fisheries conservation and management\". In \\nbrief, Spcriri talks of Stcrte so~!ereigizty, Canndn of.fishei.ies \\ncoizse~vation arid nzanclgenzerzt. \\nIn the present case, the Court has based itself on a \\njwisprudcnce which is either not entirely relevant or appears \\nto have been interpreted incorrectly. \\n111. The validity of the Carradian reservation \\nIt would of course be absurd to cast doubt, in any \\ndegree, on the sovereign power of a State to nlaintain or \\namend, whether by restricting or by extending it, a \\ndeclaration of acceptance of the Court\\'s jurisdiction, or to \\nwithdraw it whenever it wishes - always subject, of course, \\nto compliance with the procedure (and in particular any \\nthis point. \\nHowever, a State\\'s freedom to attach reservations or \\nconditions to its declaration must be exercised in conformity \\nwith the Statute and Rules of Court, with the Charter of the \\nUnited Nations, and more generally with international law \\nand with what this judge would venture to call \"l\\'ordre \\npublic interizational\". \\nWithin this optional clause \"system\", as currently \\nstructured within the framework of the \"iizterizatioi~al legal \\ncorpt4s\" - that is to stay, neither total chaos nor an absurd \\n\"bric-a-brac\" (Jean Combacau) - and which we call \\n\"interizational law\", a State\\'s freedom is immense, but \\ncannot be regarded as limitless. Any person is free to join a \\nclub or not to do so, but if they consent to join, then they \\nmust abide by the rules governing the club\\'s activities. \\nA declarant State has obligations vis-ci-vis the clat4se \\n\"system\" and its participants, current or potential, and also \\nto the party to whoin that clause is ultinzatelv addressed, \\nitamely the International Cowl-t. It is not entitled to cause \\nthat \"system\" to implode, since it also now owes it duties - \\nthe counterpart of the rights which it derives from it. The \\npossibility of withdrawing from the system remains fully \\nopen to it, but what is not acceptable is that it should distort \\nor pervert it, or compromise its existence or operation while \\nremaining within it. \\nIn the present case, I cannot but feel a certain sense of \\ndisquiet. These were events which occurred over a specific \\nperiod of two days, 10 and 12 May 1994, during which \\nalmost simultaneously Canada formulated its reservation, \\nthus precluding any review by the Court, lodged a Bill with \\nParliament and had it adopted. There is every reason to \\nthink that, in so acting, Canada wished to protect itself in \\nadvance against any judicial action. so as to be completely \\nfree to follow a particular line of conduct, over whose \\nlegality it had certain doubts. \\nThis is izot what one might have expected of a cotmtiv \\nlike Caitada, which for over 70 years has set an exanple of \\nits attachment to the Court\\'s jurisdictioil and of its respect \\nfor iilternational law. Nor is it a welcome situatioir for \\nCcinada \\'s traditioncil NAFO partners, or for the \\ninternational commt4nizy, or for the optioital clause \\n\"system\", or.for the Court itself: \\nThe latter has, most regrettably, failed to recognize that \\nrecourse to a reservation, in circumstances where a State \\nwishes to undertake speczj2c acts of dollbtful international \\nlegality, risks having a seriozcsly dantagiitg effect oiz the \\ncredibility of the optional clause \"systein \". \\nIf, for reasons of domestic or intemational policy, which \\nmay moreover be perfectly legitimate, a declarant State \\nfinds itself embarrassed by the terms of its declaration, it \\nshould provisionally withdraw that declaration for the \\nperiod required by the politiccil action which it is \\ncontemplating, rather than attachi~rg to it - I am tempted to \\nsay, eitcurnberiizg and tinderminirlg it - a reseivation \\nintended to cover a pulpose ~d~ich inigltt very well be \\nregarded as uirlawful. \\nAccording to a maxim of French civil law, \"you carznot \\nvalitlly both give arzd tcrke awu.v\". A declarant State cannot \\ntake away with one hand what it has given with the other. It \\ncannot do homage to international justice by submitting \\nitse1:f to the latter\\'s verdict in respect of those acts where it \\nconsiders that it has behaved correctly, while shunning that \\nsame justice in the case of those acts whose legality it fears \\nmay be questionable. It is not possible for a declarant State \\nto remodel the philosophy of the clause \"system\" in this \\nway,, still less to bend that \"system\" to suit its own \\ncontradictory requirements, or to mix two incolllpatible \\naims. \\nIV. The de$nition of \"conseivation and mrrnagemelrt \\nmeasz4r.e~\" \\nThe question of the \"applicable law\" for purposes of \\ndefining the expression \"conservation and inailageinent \\nmea:;ures\" has taken on great importance in this case. \\nJudge Bedjaoui is all the more convinced that this \\nexpression cannot be interpreted otherwise than within the \\nframework of international law. And since, in these \\ncircumstances, the definition and content of that expression \\ncan be fully ascertained only at the merits stage, it follows \\nthat it is only at that point that the Court would be in a \\nposition to determine whether the Canadian legislation and \\nthe resultant actions taken against Spanish vessels come \\nwithin the international definition of such measures and \\ntheir enforcement, and hence are excluded from the \\njurisdiction of the Court by virtue of reservation (4. Iiz \\nother words, this is a case where Article 79, pwugraph 7, \\nshould ltave beer1 applied, with the result that e.waminatioir \\nof the dej7iritioil and precise coirteilt of \"coiuervation aird \\nmailngeiizent measures\" would have been postponed to the \\nmerits stage, these being matters not Amling an exclusivelv \\nprelirilinaiy clzamcfer. \\nCanada\\'s reservation (4 refers to \"coiwen~ation and \\nmanagemeilt measrrres\", taken or enforced by it against \\nfishing vessels within the \"NAFO Regulatory Area\". The \\nCourt was therefore bound to interpret that expression in \\norder to identify the scope of the reservation. \\nNor does the Judgment take sufficient account of the \\nnew approach enlbodied in the interrtatiortul concept of \\n\"conservation and management nleasures\", an approach \\nalready evident at the First United Nations Confereilce on \\nthe Law of the Sea, which resulted in the \"Convention on \\nFishing and Conservation of the Living Resources of the \\nHigh Seas\", then formalized in the Montego Bay \\nConvention and, indeed, already described in 1974 in the \\nCoui-t\\'s Judgment in the Fisheries case. \\nIt is perfectly clear that this new approach could only \\nbe-- and has indeed been - an intemational one; \\nothelwise the chaos created by overfishing would have been \\nreplaced by a different form of chaos - that produced by \\neach State taking, as and wherever it thought fit, whatever \\nconservation and management measures it wished. To limit \\nthis progression to a simple harmonization of the technical \\naspects of fishing, as the Judgment has done, is to ignore the \\nof conservation and management measures, and ~r~hich gives \\nj~ldicial expression to a proj\\'ollnd need on the pm.t of States \\nfor clnr1j7ccttioiz, 11m-nzowi::ation and cooperlztion. Such \\nmeasures cannot therefore siinply be reduced to any act \\ntaken by a State with regard to its choice of c.onservation \\ntechniques, whilst ignoring ithe fact that such measures now \\nhave to be inserted into an international network of rights \\nand obligations which the States have created for \\nthemselves. Here, ecor~oritic: logic and Ieglrl logic have to \\ncombiir~e - arid indeed do so in all i~zter~~~tioizal \\nittstr~rmertts - in order to crvoirl the cham both of \\nuncontrolled o17ei;fishirlg rrild oj\\' illeg(11 regulatioil. \\nCompatibility with international law is an integral part of \\nthe intemational definition of conservation and management \\nmeasures; it is \"bllilt irl\". It is not a inatter of adjudicating on \\nthe merits or ding in any way on responsibility. It is simply \\na question of stating tliat, on a true interpretation of the \\nexpre!ssion \"conservation arid management mei~sures\", the \\nreservation cannot act as a bar to jurisdiction. \\nThe notioil of \"conselvation and management ineasures\" \\ncannot be confined, contrary to what the Judgmernt states, to \\nsimple \"factual\" or \"technical\" matters, but has to be taken \\nto refer to those types of measure which the \"r~euj legal \\norder of the sea\" has beell gradually regulating, with the \\nresult that such measures now constitute rtrl objective legal \\ncategory which cannot be other than part of knternational \\nlaw. \\nParagraph 70 of the Judgment sets out to give the \\ndefinition to be found in \"irzterrzcrtiortrrl law\" of the concept \\nof \"conservation and management measures\\'\", since it \\nbegins; with the words: \"According to international law, ...\". \\nBut, strangely, the paragraph ends with a paragraph in \\nwhich the Judgment removes froin that definition - \\nnotwithstanding that it is claimed to be the defil~ition under \\n\"itzterilational I~MJ\" - all r1:ferences to the legrrl elements \\n(such as the status or identity of the author of the measures \\nor the maritime area affected by them), retaining only the \\nteckrlical and scietltific aspects. How could ii!terncrtiortaI \\nlaw p~sihly supply such crrt iizconzplete dcfizition, ~vhick, \\ntaken Iiterrtlly, woltld appear to a~rthorize tlte .violatiotl of \\nthe most $rmly established principle of this same \\ninternrttiortal law, ilmneblfieedonz of tlze Izigl~ seas? Judge \\nBenjcroui carlrtot be pei*suadc?d that he is touclzing here trpon \\narz issue going to the merit>:, that oj\\'legnlit~~. Irt rertlio~ he \\nhas stopped short of\\'doirtg so, conj?izing Izimself\\'to poirztirlg \\nout tlztzt, lf\\'tlze Jzldgrrzeilt is to be,followed, therl ii;teiaationc~I \\nI(LM, i.1111st be bent on n course of self-destruction in \\nszlpp&ing a dejhition w1zic.h allon)s it to be so rlirectly \\nviolatt?d How is it pos.sible so ,flcrgr(znt(v to tlrrrl \\ninterno!ltional law agrrirzst itsc11f? \\nIt accordingly follows that the Canadiar. ineasures \\nrelating to tlie high seas cannot be interpreted on the basis of \\nCanada\\'s own internal legal order - for this in effect is \\nwhat the Judgment has done - since the definition of \\nconservation and management measures which the \\nJudgment claims to draw from international law has \\nultimately been reduced to a standard technical dl:fiaition -- \\nthe very same that underlies the Canadian legislation and its \\nimplementing rules - without any regard for respect of the \\nprinciple of freedom of the high seas. On the basis of its \\nreselvation as tlius interpreted by the Judgment, Canada is \\nprotected against the sanction of review by the Coui-t. But in \\nreality conservation and ~nanagement measures can be \\nassessed only by reference to international law. If this is \\nso - and it cannot be otheiwise - then the Court was \\nbound to declare itself competent at this stage and to \\nundertake an examination of tlie merits in order to determine \\nwhether the nleasures taken against the Spanish vessels \\nwere in fact conservation and management nleasures (see \\nAl-ticle 79, paragraph 7, of the Rules of Court). \\nDisserztirzg opinion of\\'Judge Rnrzjevcr \\nIn a dissenting opinion appended to the Judgment, Judge \\nRanjeva expressed the wish that this Judgtnent should not \\nbe interpreted as sounding the death-knell of the optional \\nclause system under Article 36. paragraph 2, of the Statute \\nof the International Court of Justice. He fears a desertion \\nfrom the Court as a forunl for the settlement of disputes, in \\nthe absence of guarantees to ensure the integrity of the \\nsubject matter of the dispute as prescnted in the Application \\nsubmitted by the applicant State. In Judge Ranjeva\\'s view it \\nwas not appropriate for the Court to seek to define the \\nsubject matter of the dispute at the prcli~ninary stage. \\nWhether the subject matter was iliteipreted broadly as the \\nApplicant wished, or narrowly, the question, at this \\nincidental stage of the proceedings, was whether the \\npreliminary dispute on questions of jurisdiction and \\nadmissibility calne within the tenns of the reservation \\nformulated by Canada. \\nThe case-law cited in thc Judgment is not relevant to \\njustify a restatement of the subject matter of the dispute as it \\nwas presented in the Application. In those decisions the \\nCourt restated the terms of tlie dispute after canying out a \\ndetailed examination, in light of the evidence available to it, \\nof those rnatters constantly and consistently claimed by the \\nApplicant. Moreover, in the absencc of claims by the \\nRespondent on the merits, or of any counter-claim, the \\nCourt is necessarily bound by the tenns of the claim as \\nfom~ulated in the Application. \\nWith regard to the interpretation of the Canadian \\nreservation contained in subparagraph 2 (d) of Canada\\'s \\ndeclaration of 10 May 1994, Judge Ranjeva agrees with the \\nmajority of the Members of the Court on the importance of \\nascertaiiliiig the intention of the author of thc reservation. \\nRut, in his view. a reservation to jurisdiction, while \\nunilateral in origin, is international in its effects, since it \\nbecomes part of the network made up of all the declarations \\nunder Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute. It follows that, \\nin filing its unilateral application, tlie Applicant accepts all \\nthe conditions laid down by the author of the reservation, \\nand a contractual link arises between the two parties to the \\nlitigation. It is therefore difficult to see how the reservation \\ncan bc interpreted without recourso to thc rules, principles \\nand methods of inteiprctation of international agreements, \\ndenominator common to the parties. Moreover, retracing the \\nhistorical background to Article 1 of tlie 1995 Agreement on \\nStraddling Stocks, one of the two iilstruments relevant to a \\ndefinition of conservation and management measures, Judge \\nRanjeva recalls that it was on the initiative of Canada that \\nthat Agreement included a reference to the definitions \\ncontained in the Montego Bay Conventioil, with a view,to \\ndefining more clearly what was meant by conservation and \\nmanagement measures. In the opinion of this Member of the \\nCourt, there is no contrary intemational piactice of States or \\nof international organizations which would contradict his \\nanalysis and confirm the definition given by the Court. \\nIn Judge Ranjeva\\'s view, Canada\\'s objections were not \\nof an exclusively preliminary character. \\nJudge Vereshchetin found himself unable to concur with \\nthe arguments and findings in the Judgment relating to two \\nprincipal points: \\n(a) the subject matter of the dispute between the Parties, \\nand \\n(b) the effects of the Canadian reservation on the Court\\'s \\njurisdiction in this case. \\nAs to the first point of his disagreement, Judge \\nVereshchetin takes the view that the scope of the dispute \\nbetween the Parties is much broader than the pursuit and \\narrest of the Estai and the consequences thereof. Quite apart \\nfrom this proximate cause of the dispute, it would appear \\nthat what underlies it are different perceptions by the Parties \\nof the rights and obligations which a coastal State may or \\nmay not have in a certain area of the high seas; or, more \\ngenerally, different perceptions of the relationship between \\nthe exigencies of the law of the sea, on the one hand, and \\nenvironmental law on the other. The Court had no good \\nreason for redefining and narrowing the subject matter of \\nthe dispute presented by the Applicant. \\nWith regard to the effects of the Canadian reservation, \\nJudge Vereshchetin considers that, while a State is \\nabsolutely free to join or not to join the optional clause \\nsystem, its fieedom to make reservations and conditions to \\nthe declaration deposited under Article 36, paragraph 2, of \\nthe Statute is not absolute. For example, it is uncontested \\nthat tlie Court cannot give effect to a condition imposing \\ncertain terms on the Court\\'s procedure which run counter to \\nthe latter\\'s Statute or Rules. Generally, reservations and \\nconditions must not undermine the very raison dYCtre of the \\noptional clause system. The Court as \"an organ and \\nguardian\" of international law may not accord to a \\ndocument the legal effect sought by tlie State from which it \\nemanates, without having regard to the compatibility of the \\nsaid document with the basic requirements of international \\nlaw. \\nOn tlie other hand, the Court cannot impute bad faith to \\na State. Therefore, it should seek to interpret declarations \\nand reservations thereto as consisteilt with intemational law. \\nA tern1 of a declaration or of a reservation may have a wider \\nor narrower meaning in cominon parlance or in some other \\ndiscipline, but for the Court \"the natural and ordinary\" \\nmeaning of the term is that attributed to it in international \\nlaw. The Canadian reservation would be consistent with the \\ninternational law of the sea if the expression \"conservation \\nand management measures\". obtaining in the text of the \\nreservation, were to be understood in the sense accepted in \\nrecent multilateral agreements directly related to the subject \\ncovered by the reservation. In those agreements, the concept \\n\"conservation and management measures\" is characterized \\nby reference not merely to factual and scientific criteria,. but \\nalso to legal ones. , , \\nI11 the view of Judge Vereshchetin, \"due regard\" given to \\nthe tieclarant\\'s intention, in the\\'circumstances of the case, \\nhas not revealed with certainty,\\':the evident intention of the \\ndeclarant\" at the time material .for the interpretation of the \\nreservation. In any event,\\' this intention cannot be \\ncontrolling and conclusive . for the outcome of the \\ninterpretation by the Court. \\nJudge Vereshchetin considers that the scope (rcrtione \\nn~aterilie and I-crtioize personae) of the Canadian reservation, \\nas well as its implications for the Court\\'s jurisdiction in this \\ncase., could not be established \\'!ith certainty by the Court. \\nTherefore, the correct course of action for the Court would \\nhave been to find that in the circumstances of the case the \\nobjections of Canada did not have an exclusively \\npreliminary character. \\nDissenting opirtion of Judge Torres Benzdrdez \\nIn his dissenting opinion Judge Toires Bemhrdez \\nconcludes that the Court has full jurisdiction to adjudicate \\non the dispute brought before it by the Application filed by \\nSpain on 28 March 1995. \\nHe has reached this conclusion after a thorough study of \\n- the subject matter of the dispute (where he was in total \\ndisagreement with the definition adopted by a majority \\nof the Court, a definition which in his view accords with \\nneither the applicable law nor with the relevant \\njurisprudence of the Court, or with that of the Permanent \\nCourt); \\n- the optional clause system in general, including the role \\nwithin that system of the principles of good faith and \\nmutual confidence; \\n- the question of the admissibility or opposability as \\nagainst Spain, in the circumstances of the case, of the \\nreservation contained in subparagraph 2 ((0 of Canada\\'s \\ndeclaration (in relation to which. in the judge\\'s view, the \\nCourt has declined to exercise its right of review over \\nabz4se of the optional clause system); \\n- and the interpretation of Canada\\'s declaration of 10 May \\n1994, including the reservation contained in \\nsubparagraph 2 (4. In this regard Judge Torres \\nBemardez expresses his conviction that the subject of \\nthe interpretation which the Court is called upon to \\nundertake is Canada\\'s declaration itself, including the \\nreservation in subparagraph (4, arid not, as tlie \\n1994, of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court \\ntog:ether with the said reservation; Judge Torres \\nBe:rnBrdez rejects the extreme subjectivity displayed by \\nthe majority in the Judgment in their approach to \\ninterpretation, an approa.ch which he considers to be \\ncontrary to current international law and to the principle \\n.\\'of :legal certainty in relations between declara~it States. . \\nThe basic reasoiis on which his dissenting opinion- are \\nfounded are three. First, .the fundamental role of the \\nprinciple of good faith, both in the modus oyeri~i~di of the \\noptional clause system an.d in the interpretation and \\napplication by the Court of declarations made by States \\nunder Article 36, paragraph 2, of its Statute. Se~:ondly, the \\nequally fundamental distinction which must always be \\ndrawn between. on the one. hand, the principle of consent by \\nthe Sta.tes concerned to the jurisdiction of the Court and, on \\nthe other, an interpretation;in accordance with the rules of \\ninterpretation laid down by international law, of the consent \\nobjectively demonstrated in declarations at the tiine of their \\ndeposit with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. \\nFinally, the no less fundamental requireiiient of internatioiial \\nprocedure that, in the interest of the principle of tlie equality \\nof the parties, the sovereign right of the applicant State to \\ndefine the subject matter of tlie dispute which it is \\nsubmitting to the Court must be just as fully respected as the \\nsovereign right of the respondent State to seek to oppose tlie \\nCourt\\'s jurisdiction by presenting preliininary or other \\nobjections, or by .filing a counter-claim of its own. \\nEach of these fundamental reasons is sufficient in itself \\nto make it impossible for Judge Torres Bernirdez to \\nsubscribe to a judgment, the effect of which will, he fears, \\nbe particularly negative, even beyond tlie present case, for \\nthe development of the optional clause system as a iiieans of \\nacceptance by States of the compulsory jurisdiction of the \\n'},\n",

In essence, the treaty provides that \\nrefugee claimants m ust, as a general rule, seek protection in whichever of the two \\ncountries they first enter after leaving their country of origin. The Safe Third Country \\nAgreement is given effect in Canadian domestic law through the Immigration and \\nRefugee Protection Act  (“IRPA”) and its regulations (“ IRPR”). Under s.  101(1)(e) of \\nthe IRPA, refugee status claims are ineligible to be considered in Canada if the claimant \\ncame from a country designated by the IRPR. Section 102(1)(a) of the IRPA provides \\nthat countries may only be so designated if they are viewed as complying with their \\nnon-refoulement obligations under international law, which prohibit directly or \\nindirectly returning a person to a place where they would face certain kinds of \\nirreparable harm,  including threats to their life or freedom, torture and cruel or \\ndegrading treatment. Section 102(2) lists factors for the Governor in Council to \\n \\nin Council to ensure the continuing review of those factors with respect to each \\ndesignated country. The United States is designated under s. 159.3 of the IRPR. \\n Several individuals arrived from the United States to claim refugee \\nprotection in Canada. Their claims were ineligi ble to be referred to the Refugee \\nProtection Division, pursuant to s.  101(1)(e) of the IRPA and s.  159.3 of the IRPR. \\nHowever, most of the individuals were not returned to the United States, as they had \\nobtained a stay of removal or temporary resident perm it. One individual was returned \\nto the United States. That individual says American officials detained her in solitary \\nconfinement for a week pending the results of a tuberculosis test and then detained her \\nfor another three weeks in an abnormally cold facility, where individuals convicted of \\ncriminal offences were present and where her religious dietary restrictions were not \\nrespected. \\n The individuals whose claims were ineligible to be referred to the Refugee \\nProtection Division, along with public interest litigants (collectively, the “applicants”), \\nchallenged the validity of s. 159.3 of the IRPR on the basis that the designation of the \\nUnited States was outside the authority granted by the IRPA because of \\npost-promulgation constraints on the Governor in C ouncil’s statutory authority to \\nmaintain a designation. They also argued that s.  159.3 of the IRPR and s. 101(1)(e) of \\nthe IRPA violated the rights guaranteed by ss.  7 and 15 of the Charter, asserting that \\nthe legislative scheme results in Canadian immigra tion officers summarily returning \\n \\ntheir rights under international law, including those related to detention and \\nnon-refoulement. \\n The Federal Court judge rejected the ultra vires argument because whether \\na regulation is within the authority delegated by a statute is assessed based on facts at \\nthe time of promulgation. With respect to s.  7 of the Charter, she found the alleged \\nviolations were largely substantiated and most grave, and that deprivations of liberty \\nand security of the person for refugee claimants arose because those returned to the \\nUnited States faced risks of refoulement as well as other harm relating to immigration \\ndetention. She concluded  that s. 7 was viola ted and that this breach was not justified \\nunder s.  1, and she therefore declined to rule on the s.  15 claim. She declared \\ns. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA and s. 159.3 of the IRPR of no force or effect pursuant to s. 52 \\nof the Constitution Act, 1982. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal brought by the \\nministers, dismissed the cross -appeal of the s.  15 claim and the ultra vires argument, \\nand set aside the judgment of the Federal Court. The basis for these conclusions was \\nthat the causation requirements for a Charter claim were not met because the applicants \\nimproperly targeted the legislation rather than administrative conduct. \\n Held: The appeal should be allowed in part. \\n Section 159.3 of the IRPR is not ultra vires, nor does it breach s. 7 of the \\nCharter. However, the challenge based on s. 15 of the Charter, which was not decided \\n \\n The applicants’ submission that s. 159.3 of the IRPR is ultra vires the IRPA \\nshould be rejected. Regulations derive their  validity from the statute that creates the \\npower to promulgate a regulation, and not from the executive body by which they are \\nmade. The limits imposed by the enabling statute are therefore fundamental to \\ndetermining whether a regulation is intra vires that statute. In the instant case, \\ns. 102(1)(a) and (2) of the IRPA establishes conditions precedent to designation for the \\npurposes of s.  101(1)(e); these conditions must be met before, not after, a country is \\ndesignated. While s. 102(3) creates an obligation for the Governor in Council to ensure \\nthe continuing review of the s. 102(2) factors, these reviews are not directed at whether \\nthe regulation exceeds the limits imposed by the statute. The s. 102(3) reviews are thus \\noutside the scope of a challenge all eging that s.  159.3 of the IRPR is ultra vires the \\nIRPA, although they may well be subject to other forms of challenge based on \\nadministrative law principles. Whether or not the impugned regulation is intra vires its \\nenabling statute must be examined at th e time of promulgation. Regulations benefit \\nfrom a presumption of validity. The applicants have not shown that on the date of \\npromulgation, the designation of the United States was not authorized by s.  102(1)(a) \\nor (2) of the IRPA. \\n The applicants’ s.  7 Charter challenge was properly constituted. The \\ns. 159.3 designation is the legislative basis for the relevant ineligibility determinations \\nand is thus properly subject to constitutional scrutiny. To succeed, a Charter claim must \\nshow a causal link between s tate action and the violation of the relevant right or \\n \\nthat the impugned state action be the only or the dominant cause of the prejudice \\nsuffered by the claimant. As a result, the mere fact that other forms of state action may \\nalso have a causal connection to the harms alleged does not mean that a challenge to \\nlegislation is improperly constituted. Furthermore, Charter challenges need not target \\nprovisions that might have se rved to prevent or cure the harms alleged when the \\nprovision of general application to which those other provisions relate is a cause of the \\nmischief. But when a Charter challenge targets a provision in an interrelated legislative \\nscheme, the potential imp act of related provisions, including preventative or curative \\nmeasures, must be reviewed. Courts must consider legislative provisions in their entire \\nstatutory context, irrespective of how the parties frame their challenge of a legislative \\nscheme. In the i nstant case, preventative and curative provisions are both relevant in \\ndifferent ways to the applicants’ Charter claim; however, they did not need to target \\nthese provisions in addition to s. 159.3 of the IRPR to constitute their challenge. \\n It was also open to the applicants to challenge s.  159.3 of the IRPR rather \\nthan administrative conduct, such as s. 102(3) reviews, and seek a declaration that the \\nprovision is of no force or effect because it is inconsistent with the Charter. The \\ns. 102(3) reviews do not play a curative role, as they do not make  after-the-fact relief \\navailable on an individual basis. They are also distinct from targeted preventative \\nmeasures, which preclude the application of a general rule, often through legislative \\nexceptions. While the administrative conduct that led to the designation being \\nmaintained may also be susceptible to constitutional challenge in its own right, the \\n \\nscrutiny. Similarly, while t he applicants might have challenged administrative \\ndecisions pertaining to the applicability of exceptions or the availability of exemptions, \\nthis does not preclude challenges to s. 159.3. \\n The first stage of the s. 7 analysis makes clear that s. 159.3 engages liberty \\nand security of the person. Assessing the constitutional implications of effects that \\nmaterialize in other countries does not amount to applying the Charter to foreign \\ngovernments. The challenge in the instant case is directed at the legislati ve scheme, \\nwhich is undoubtedly state action that attracts Charter scrutiny. Whether an alleged \\neffect of the scheme exists is a question of fact, for which the standard of review is \\npalpable and overriding error, while the scope of a s. 7 interest is a question of law, for \\nwhich the standard of review is correctness. Although the evidence does not support \\nthe Federal Court judge’s finding that returnees face automatic detention in the United \\nStates, the risks of detention upon return to the United States, as well as three aspects \\nof detention conditions as found by the Federal Court judge — the use of medical \\nisolation, abnormally cold conditions and deficiencies in medical care — fall within \\nthe scope of liberty and security of the person.  In addition, tak ing the applicants’ \\nposition on s. 7 engagement at its highest, it can be assumed that the following effects \\noccur and are within the scope of the s. 7 interests: the non-accommodation of religious \\ndietary needs, detention in a facility housing criminally convicted individuals and risks \\nof refoulement flowing from the one -year bar policy and the Un ited States’ approach \\n \\n To establish s.  7 engagement, challengers must not only demonstrate \\neffects falling within the scope of the s. 7 interests, but also that these effects are caused \\nby Canadian state action. As Canada has no jurisdiction to dictate the actions of foreign \\nauthorities, drawing a causal connection to Canadian state action requires showing that \\nCanadian authorities were implicated in how the harms arose. Accordingly, challengers \\nwill succeed in drawing a causal connection to Canadian state action at least where \\nCanada’s participation is a necessary precondition for the deprivation. Further, as \\nCanada cannot foresee all the actions that foreign authorities will take, it must be shown \\nthat Canadian authorities knew, or ought to have known, that the harms could arise as \\na result of Canada’s actions. This foreseeability threshold can be established by a \\nreasonable inference, drawn  on a balance of probabilities. What is required is a \\nsufficient connection, having regard to the context of the case. Here, it is clear that the \\nrelevant Canadian state action — s. 159.3 of the IRPR along with the broader legislative \\nscheme — is a necessary precondition to each of the proven or presumed effects related \\nto detention and refoulement. Without the Safe Third Country Agreement regime, \\nindividuals could advance their refugee protection claims in Canada; instead, they are \\nsent back to the United States by Canadian officials acting under legislative authority, \\nwhere they face (or are presumed to face) these effects. However, the Federal Court \\njudge erred in her application of the foreseeability standard established by the Court in \\nSuresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) , 2002 SCC 1, [2002] 1 \\nS.C.R. 3, and explained in Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] \\n3 S.C.R. 1101. With respect to the cold temperatures in detention facilities, deficiencies \\n \\nof religious dietary restrictions, the record does not support a finding that these effects \\nwere a foreseeable consequence of Canada’s actions. By contrast, the record \\nsubstantiates that the other negative effects were entirely foreseeable, such as the risk \\nof detention, the “one -year bar”, the treatment of gender -based claim and the \\nwidespread practice of medical isolation. These infringements of liberty and security \\nof the person are causally connected to Canadian state action and must be assessed in \\nrelation to the principles of fundamental justice. \\n The applicable principles of fundamental justice in the instant case are \\noverbreadth and gross disproportionality as described by the Co urt in Bedford. The \\n“shocks the conscience” standard may well be relevant to the review of individualized \\ndecisions, but it is not relevant to Charter challenges to legislation; it is therefore not \\nthe appropriate measure here. When assessing whether legislation violates the Bedford \\nprinciples of fundamental justice, courts must identify the legislative purpose and then \\nassess if, in light of that purpose, the legislation breached any of the relevant principles. \\nWhen a legislative objective is at issue as p art of the s.  7 analysis, the focus is the \\npurpose of the impugned provisions, although the broader legislative scheme may \\nprovide clues as to the narrower provisions’ purpose. Here, taken together, the \\nstatement of objectives of the IRPA, the text, contex t, and scheme of the legislation, \\nand the extrinsic evidence suggest that the purpose of s.  159.3 of the IRPR is to share \\nresponsibility for fairly considering refugee claims with the United States, in \\naccordance with the principle of non-refoulement. It is in light of this purpose that the \\n \\nalong with the presumed risks of refoulement — must be assessed for overbreadth and \\ngross disproportionality. \\n The impugned le gislative scheme in the instant case is not overbroad or \\ngrossly disproportionate. With respect to overbreadth, the question is whether the \\nscheme is so broad in scope that it includes some conduct that bears no relation to its \\npurpose. The analysis is foc used not on whether Parliament has chosen the least \\nrestrictive means, but whether the chosen means infringe life, liberty or security of the \\nperson in a way that has no connection with the mischief contemplated by the \\nlegislature. The risk of detention in the United States, with opportunities for release and \\nreview, is related to the legislative objective. Sharing responsibility for refugee claims \\nwith another state will necessarily expose returnees to the foreign legal regime that \\ngoverns refugee claimants’ presence in that country. A degree of difference as between \\nthe legal schemes applicable in the two countries can be tolerated, so long as the \\nAmerican system is not fundamentally unfair. While the record shows that returnees \\nface a risk of detention in  the United States, it also discloses mechanisms that create \\nopportunities for release and provide for review by administrative decision makers and \\ncourts. There is no basis to infer that these arrangements are fundamentally unfair, and \\nthus the risk of de tention that returnees face is not overbroad. Similarly, the use of \\nmedical isolation to control public health risks is not fundamentally unfair. The \\napplicants do not point to evidence that would sustain an inference that medical \\nisolation is being used improperly in the American immigration detention system. With \\n \\neffects on the s.  7 interests are so grossly disproportionate to its purposes that they \\ncannot rationally be supported. Neither a risk of detention with opportunities for release \\nand review nor a risk of medical isolation meets this high threshold. In Canada, as in \\nthe United States, these risks are within the mutually held norms accepted by our free \\nand democratic societies. \\n A provision mandating return to a real and not speculative risk of \\nrefoulement, however, would be overbroad as it would bear no relation to the purpose \\nof the impugned legislation, which has respect for the non-refoulement principle at its \\ncore. Such a provision would similarly be grossly disproportionate because it would, \\nby definition, expose individuals to risks to their life or freedom, torture or other \\nfundamental human rights violations. However, the impugned legislation in the instant \\ncase does not simply mandate return: there are also related curative provisions that must \\nbe factored into the analysis, including administrative deferrals of removal ( IRPA, \\ns. 48(2)), temporary resident permits (s.  24), humanitarian and compassionate \\nexemptions (s. 25.1(1)) and public policy exemptions (s. 25.2(1)). When the impugned \\nlegislative scheme contains safety valves, the question is whether these mechanisms — \\nproperly interpreted and applied — are sufficient to ensure that no deprivations \\ncontrary to the principles of fundamental justice occur. When the IRPA’s safety valves \\nare activated, claimants can be exempted from return. If they are not returned to the \\nUnited States, they do not face any risk of refoulement from the United States. The \\nsafety valves can therefore intervene to cure what might otherwise be unconstitutional \\n \\nfundamental justice stage of s. 7 because they can be exercised in order to address the \\nspecific deprivation at issue, in this case the risk of refoulement. Properly interpreted, \\nthese mechanisms in the broader statutory scheme are sufficient to ensure that \\nindividuals are not subjected to real and not speculative risks of refoulement, if such  \\nrisks do exist. These mechanisms must be understood in light of the discretion that \\nArticle 6 of the Safe Third Country Agreement preserves for Canada to consider claims \\nwhen it is in its public interest to do so. The mere fact that the mechanisms predate the \\ntreaty does not make them irrelevant; when the agreement was signed, Canadian \\ndomestic law already included provisions that could facilitate individualized \\nconsideration of claimants’ circumstances. Thus, even assuming that claimants face \\nreal and not  speculative risks of refoulement from the United States, the Canadian \\nlegislative scheme provides safety valves that guard against such risks. For that reason, \\nthe legislative scheme implementing the Safe Third Country Agreement  is not \\noverbroad or grossl y disproportionate and therefore accords with the principles of \\nfundamental justice. Consequently, no breach of s.  7 of the Charter has been \\nestablished, and it is not necessary to undertake a s. 1 analysis. \\n The challenge based on s.  15 of the Charter should be sent back to the \\nFederal Court for determination. The basis of this cla im is that women fearing \\ngender-based persecution are adversely affected by the legislative scheme. Given the \\nprofound seriousness of the matter, the size and complexity of the r ecord and the \\nconflicting affidavit evidence, it would be imprudent for the Court to dispose of the \\n \\nwith no avenue of appeal. While the Federal Court judge should not be faulted for \\nexercising judicial restraint and not deciding the s. 15 claim, a false economy has arisen \\ndue to the need to remit these issues. The principle of judicial policy underlying \\nrestraint in constitutional cases is sound, but it must be weighed against other factors, \\nsuch as the possibility of an appeal and fairness to the parties. Claims based on s.  15 \\nare not secondary issues only to be reached after all other issues are considered. The \\nCharter should not be treated as if it establishes a hierarchy of rights in which s.  15 \\noccupies a lower tier. \\nCases Cited \\n Applied: Canada (Attorney General) v.

Conclusion 183 \\n \\n \\n[1] Canada and the United States are parties to a bilateral treaty designed to \\nenhance their sharing of responsibility for considering refugee status claims. In essence, \\nthe treaty provides that refugee claimants must, as a general rule, seek protection in \\nwhichever of the two countries they first enter after leaving their country of origin. The \\nAgreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United \\nStates of America for cooperation in the examination of refugee status claims from \\nnationals of third countries, Can. T.S. 2004 No. 2, is known as the “Safe Third Country \\nAgreement”. The treaty’s preamble speaks to the parties’ mutual recognition that both \\ncountries offer generous systems of refugee protection, such that claimants can find \\neffective protection in either country. Sharing responsibility is thus understood as \\njustified, even though the laws of each country differ. \\n[2] The Safe Third Country Agreement  is given effect in Canadian domestic \\nlaw through the Immigration and Refugee Prote ction Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (“IRPA”), \\nand its regulations. Under s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA, refugee status claims are ineligible \\nto be considered in Canada if the claimant came from a country designated by the \\nregulations. Countries may only be so designated if they are viewed as complying with \\ntheir “ non-refoulement” obligations under international law. These obligations — \\nwhich prohibit directly or indirectly returning a person to a place where they would \\nface certain kinds of irreparable harm, including threats to their life or freedom, torture \\nand cruel or degrading treatment — are the cornerstone of the international refugee \\nprotection regime (see, for a plain language summary, United Nations, Office of the \\n \\ninternational human rights law , July 5, 2018 (online)). A designated country is thus \\nseen as a safe third country in that it is viewed as an appropriate partner with which \\nCanada can share responsibility for considering refugee claims. The United States is \\ndesignated under s.  159.3 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations , \\nSOR/2002-227 (“IRPR”). It is the sole designated country in Canadian law. \\n[3] The appellants challenge this scheme principally on the basis that it \\nviolates the rights guaranteed by ss.  7 and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and \\nFreedoms. They claim that the legislation results in Canadian immigration officers \\nsummarily returning claimants to the United States without considering whether the \\nUnited States will respect their rights under international law, including those relating \\nto non-refoulement and detention. \\n[4] Certain questions are not in issue in this appeal. First, there is no debate \\nthat safe third country agreements, as a general matter, may b e compatible with \\ninternational law (see, e.g., I.  Atak and F.  Crépeau, “Asylum in the twenty -first \\ncentury: Trends and challenges”, in A.  Triandafyllidou, ed., Routledge Handbook of \\nImmigration and Refugee Studies  (2nd ed. 2023), 358, at p.  363). Second, the \\nappellants do not attack the validity of the Safe Third Country Agreement itself. Third, \\nthis Court is not tasked with assessing the wisdom of Canadian immigration policy, a \\nmatter that courts are not institutionally designed to evaluate, much less reform. Fourth, \\nthis Court is not asked to resolve the thorny issue of irregular entry into Canada at \\n \\n“Citizenship, Non -Citizenship and The Rule of Law” (2018), 69 U.N.B.L.J. 19, at \\npp. 35-37). Instead, the appeal focuses on whether the Canadian legislative regime \\nimplementing the Safe Third Country Agreement — that is, the relevant provisions of \\nthe IRPA and IRPR — complies with constitutional and administrative law \\nrequirements. \\n[5] The complexion of the judgments below on the Charter questions could \\nnot be more different. The Federal Court judge, who reviewed the evidence first-hand, \\nfound that the alleged s.  7 violations were largely substantiated and most grave. \\nDeprivations of liberty and security of the person for refugee claimants arose because \\nthose returned to the United States faced risks of refoulement as well as other harm \\nrelating to immigration detention. In the result, she was persuaded that s. 7 was violated \\nand that this breach was not justified under s. 1. She declared s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA \\nand s. 159.3 of the IRPR of no force or effect under s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982. \\n[6] By contrast, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the Charter challenge \\nwas not properl y constituted and thus allowed the appeal brought by the Minister of \\nCitizenship and Immigration and the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency \\nPreparedness. Despite the appellants’ evidence and the findings of the Federal Court \\njudge, the Court of Appeal  found that the causation requirements for a Charter claim \\nwere not met because the appellants improperly targeted the legislation rather than \\nadministrative conduct. Respectfully, I disagree with the Court of Appeal and prefer \\n \\ndesignating the United States was an appropriate focus of the Charter challenge. In \\nparticular, since the s.  159.3 designation is the legislative basis for the relevant \\nineligibility determinations, it is properly subject to constitutional scrutiny. \\n[7] Further, I agree with the Federal Court judge’s findings that the liberty and \\nsecurity of the person interests of refugee claimants are engaged by the Canadian \\nlegislation that renders their claims ineligible. Specifically, I reject the notion that the \\nclaimants’ s.  7 interests are not engaged simply because the legislation contains \\nmeasures that could ultimately have offered protection. This, I think, rests on a \\nmisunderstanding of Febles v. Canada (Citizenship  and Immigration), 2014 SCC 68, \\n[2014] 3 S.C.R. 431, and is inconsistent with this Court’s approach to s.  7 set out in \\nCanada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101. \\n[8] The findings of fact relating to the treatment of refugee claimants made by \\nthe Federal Court judge are troubling. Apart from her determinations that detention in \\nthe United States is “automatic” and that detention conditions cause a risk of \\nrefoulement, the respondents have failed to show that those conclusions are ta inted by \\nreviewable errors. While she made no finding that American asylum policies give rise \\nto a risk of refoulement, I am nevertheless persuaded that the record substantiated her \\nview that the designation of the United States engages the liberty and sec urity of the \\nperson interests spoken to in s. 7 of the Charter. \\n[9] After engagement of these constitutionally protected interests is \\n \\nprior to his appointment to the bench, d escribes as the “key question” in refugee \\nprotection decision making: whether the deprivation of the liberty or security of the \\nperson interests is in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice (“Revisiting \\nthe Application of Section 7 of the Charter in Immigration and Refugee Protection” \\n(2017), 68 U.N.B.L.J. 312, at p.  356). This requires an examination of whether \\nCanadian state action “has interfered with those fundamental interests pursuant to a fair \\nprocess and in a manner rationally connect ed and proportionate to the objectives of \\nCanada’s immigration laws” ( ibid.). The focus of this examination is not on whether \\nasylum law in the United States mirrors the law in Canada. Instead, the focus is on the \\npurpose and effects of the Canadian legislative scheme. Of particular significance here \\nis whether the ineligibility rule in the legislation is tempered by related provisions that \\nprovide relief from potential s.  7 violations. As this Court held in Canada (Attorney \\nGeneral) v. PHS Community Servic es Society , 2011 SCC 44, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 134, \\nspeaking specifically to what are usefully described as curative exemptions, legislative \\n“safety valve[s]” can ensure that deprivations of the s.  7 interests are not arbitrary, \\noverbroad or grossly disproportionate (para. 113). \\n[10] From this perspective, and notwithstanding the findings of the Federal \\nCourt judge that the s.  7 interests are engaged, the challenge to s.  159.3 of the IRPR \\nultimately fails. The IRPA and the IRPR contain exceptions, exemptions and revie w \\nobligations that address the problems associated with ineligibility and removal from \\nCanada. These provisions give voice in Canadian law to the idea, expressed in Article 6 \\n \\nwhen it determines that doing so is in its public interest. In particular, even where \\nineligibility under the scheme would lead to deprivations of liberty or security of the \\nperson — as the Federal Court judge found — the legislative scheme’s discret ionary \\nexemptions ensure compliance with the principles of fundamental justice. In sum, the \\nlegislation is tailored to prevent certain infringements of s. 7 interests and, importantly \\nfor present purposes, survives constitutional scrutiny here because legi slative safety \\nvalves provide curative relief.  \\n[11] While the Federal Court judge stated that safeguards in the scheme were \\n“illusory”, her assessment did not consider all the relevant safety valves. This omission \\nwas an error of law that led her to improperly  discount how the legislative scheme \\nallows Canada to consider refugee status claims when the principles of fundamental \\njustice so require, notwithstanding their presumptive ineligibility. As a result, I am \\nrespectfully of the view that the Federal Court’s conclusion that the designation of the \\nUnited States for the purposes of the Safe Third Country Agreement breached s.  7 \\ncannot stand. \\n[12] It may well be that, in practice, administrative decision makers do not \\nalways construe or deploy the legislative safety valves appropriately. In such cases, the \\nlegislation itself remains valid, but administrative and Charter relief remains available \\non an individual basis. For instance, the Charter can prohibit administrative actors from \\nreturning refugee claimants to places where they would face circumstances that would \\n \\ndifficulties they faced in seeking refugee protection at Canadian land ports of entry, \\nthey have not asked this Court to provide them with individualized relief. Instead, they \\nfocus their constitutional challenge solely on alleged defects in the legislative scheme \\nitself in order to have s.  159.3 of the IRPR declared of no force or effect under the \\nConstitution Act, 1982. \\n[13] While I reject the appellants’ s.  7 challenge to the legislative scheme and \\ntheir other arguments, I would nevertheless allow the appeal in part. I would remit the \\nappellants’ claim that the legislation violates Charter-guaranteed equality rights, which \\nwas not decided by either court below. The appellants’ s.  15 claim rests on grave \\nallegations that women facing gender-based persecution and sexual violence are often \\ndenied refugee status in the United States contrary to Article  33 of the Convention \\nRelating to the Status of Refugees, Can. T.S. 1969 No. 6 (“Refugee Convention”). The \\nevidentiary basis for the appellants’ s.  15 claim remains disputed and no factual \\nfindings were made in the Federal Court on which we can rely on appeal. It would be \\nimprudent for this Court to dispose of the equality rights claim as would a court of first \\ninstance and thus leave the losing party with no avenue of appeal. \\nII. The Parties \\n[14] The appellants are individual refugee claimants and public interest \\nlitigants. The respondents are  the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the \\n \\n[15] Each individual appellant arrived from the United States to claim refugee \\nprotection in Canada. Because they arrived at land ports of entry, their cl aims were \\nineligible to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division, pursuant to s. 101(1)(e) of \\nthe IRPA and s. 159.3 of the IRPR. \\n[16] ABC and her daughters are citizens of El Salvador, where they say they \\nwere subject to gender -based persecution and sexua l violence committed by gangs. \\nThey fled to the United States in 2016, where they were initially detained. American \\nofficials advised them they were subject to removal proceedings. ABC and her \\ndaughters were released for the duration of those proceedings. In 2017, ABC and her \\ndaughters arrived at the land port of entry at Fort Erie, Ontario to claim refugee \\nprotection in Canada. They say that a Canadian Border Services Agency (“CBSA”) \\nofficer advised them that they should withdraw their claim, as they would  be found \\nineligible in keeping with the Safe Third Country Agreement . They decided to return \\nto the United States. About six months later, ABC and her daughters again attempted \\nto make a claim for refugee protection. ABC’s husband, whose own refugee claim  in \\nCanada was pending, retained legal counsel in anticipation that the CBSA would \\ndetermine that ABC’s and her daughters’ claims were ineligible. When the CBSA made \\nthat determination, it agreed to defer removal briefly. Counsel applied for judicial \\nreview and also obtained a stay of removal, which remains in effect while this appeal \\n \\n[17] Ms. Mustefa is an Ethiopian citizen and member of the Oromo ethnic \\ngroup. When she was 11, she travelled alone to the United States on a visitor’s visa for \\nmedical treatment. She stayed there through the end of high school. Ms.  Mustefa says \\nthat oppression of the Oromo in Ethiopia escalated around this time. She decided not \\nto return to Ethiopia but believed a policy known as the “one -year bar” made her \\nineligible to claim asylum in the United States. In 2017, Ms.  Mustefa travelled to the \\nland port of entry in Saint -Bernard-de-Lacolle, Quebec to make a claim for refugee \\nprotection in Canada. The CBSA determined her claim was ineligible. She was returned \\nto the United  States, where she says that American officials detained her in solitary \\nconfinement for a week pending the results of a tuberculosis test and then detained her \\nfor another three weeks in an abnormally cold facility, where individuals convicted of \\ncriminal offences were present and where her religious dietary restrictions were not \\nrespected. While detained, Ms. Mustefa was able to communicate with her family and \\nwith legal counsel, and she was later released on a bond. Ms.  Mustefa applied for \\npermanent residence in the United States, which was granted in 2021. \\n[18] Ms. Al Nahass and her three children are citizens of Syria. She and her \\nfamily lived in Saudi  Arabia, where her husband worked. In 2015, Ms.  Al Nahass \\ntravelled to Syria for medical treatment. She says  that during that trip, she was \\nkidnapped, attacked and threatened with sexual violence. The family subsequently \\ntravelled to the United States. While there, she says that her husband lost his job, \\njeopardizing the family’s residency in Saudi Arabia. Ms. Al Nahass feared returning to \\n \\nMs. Al Nahass says that she grew concerned with what she perceived as public hatred \\nexpressed towards Muslim and Arab people and with actions taken by the United States \\nexecutive. She and her family decided to seek refugee protection in Canada. When they \\ndid so at the land port of entry in Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, the CBSA determined their \\nclaims were ineligible. Ms. Al Nahass contacted legal counsel, who filed a motion for \\nan emergency stay of removal at the Federal Court. An interim stay was granted. Before \\nthe full stay motion could be heard, the Minister granted the family temporary resident \\npermits. They have now been granted permanent residence based on humanitarian and \\ncompassionate grounds. \\n[19] The appellants introduced into evidence affidavits from ten anonymized, \\nnon-party affiants. Each affiant says that they were returned to the United States after \\ntheir claims were found ineligible pursuant to the Safe Third Country Agreement. The \\nnine affiants who answered written cross -examinations stated that, after their return, \\nthey were detained by American authorities. With one exception, they were released \\nfrom detention pursuant to an administrative decision or bond hearing. Likewise, they \\nmade asylum claims in the United States with the assistance of counsel. One affiant \\ncould not meet the bond set for their release. That individual was removed from the \\nUnited States after unsuccessfully appealing the i mmigration judge’s unfavourable \\ndecision to the American Board of Immigration Appeals and, subsequently, to the \\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \\n \\nA. Federal Court, 2020 FC 770, [2021] 1 F.C.R. 209 (McDonald J.) \\n[20] The appellants challenged the validity of s. 159.3 of the IRPR on the basis \\nthat the designation of the United States was outside the authority granted by the IRPA. \\nThey also said that s.  159.3 of the IRPR and s.  101(1)(e) of the IRPA unjustifiably \\nviolated ss. 7 and 15 of the Charter. The Federal Court judge rejected the argument \\nthat the regulation was ultra vires but found an unjustified s. 7 breach. Because of her \\nconclusion on s. 7, she declined to rule on the s. 15 claim.  \\n[21] The vires argument was rejected because Canadian Council for Refugees \\nv. Canada, 2008 FCA 229, [2009] 3 F.C.R. 136 (“CCR (2008)”), at para. 57, held that \\nwhether a regulation is within the authority delegated by a statute is assessed based on \\nfacts at the time of promulgation.  \\n[22] The Federal Court judge found that the Charter applied. Deprivations \\neffected by foreign actors remain “subject to the guarantee of fundamental justice, as \\nlong as there is a sufficient causal connection between our government’s participation \\nand the deprivation” (para. 100, citing Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and \\nImmigration), 2002 SCC 1, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3; see also Federal Court reasons, at \\npara. 93, citing Bedford, at paras. 58 and 75-76). \\n[23] In the Federal Court judge’s view, the impugned scheme engages “liberty” \\nbecause “ineligible [Safe Third Country Agreement] claimants are . . . immediately and \\n \\nperson given the risk of refoulement and the conditions of detention in the United \\nStates. She found there was a “real and not speculative” risk that ABC would have been \\nrefouled from the United States based on “the challenges in advancing an asylum \\nclai[m] for those detained”, such as barriers to accessing legal advice (para.  106). In \\naddition, she concluded that some detention conditions in the United States engage \\nsecurity of the person since being subjected to these conditions flows directly from \\nCanadian officials’ conduct in returning claimants there.  \\n[24] The Federal Court judge held that t hese deprivations do not comport with \\nthe principles of fundamental justice. She concluded that, despite the suggestion that \\nthere are certain “safeguards” available to protect against overbreadth and gross \\ndisproportionality, these remedies “are largely out of reach and are therefore ‘illusory’” \\n(paras. 129-30, distinguishing Tapambwa v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) , \\n2019 FCA 34, [2020] 1 F.C.R. 700). \\n[25] The Federal Court judge held that the s.  7 violations were not justified \\nunder s. 1 of the Charter and “decline[d]” to address the s. 15 arguments (see para. 154, \\nciting Carter v. Canada (Attorney General) , 2015 SCC 5, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 331, at \\npara. 93). She declared s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA and s. 159.3 of the IRPR of no force or \\neffect pursuant to s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and suspended the declaration for \\nsix months.  \\nB. Federal Court of Appeal, 2021 FCA 72, [2021] 3 F.C.R. 294 (Noël C.J. and \\n \\n[26] Stratas J.A., writing for a unanimous Court of Appeal, allowed the \\nministers’ appeal, dismissed the cross -appeal of the s.  15 claim and the ultra vires  \\nargument, set aside the judgment of the Federal Court, and dismissed the applications \\nfor judicial review.  \\n[27] The court found that the Charter claim was not properly constituted \\nbecause it failed to account for two practical rules flowing from the requirement that \\nimpugned state action must be the cause of a Charter infringement (para. 57). The first \\nrule is that “provisions in an interrelated legislative scheme cannot be taken in isolation \\nand selectively challenged” because “[o]ther related provisions may be responsible [for \\nthe alleged Charter violation] or may prevent or cure any possible defects” (para. 58(a), \\nciting PHS). The second rule is that when administrative action or inaction is the source \\nof a rights infringement, that is what must be challenged rather than the legislation \\n(para. 58(b), citing Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada (Minister of \\nJustice), 2000 SCC 69, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1120). The court concluded that  if anything \\nwere to blame for the alleged violations, it would be the Government of Canada’s \\nreviews of the United States’ designation, which are required under s.  102(3) of the \\nIRPA, and related administrative conduct. Thus, by targeting s.  101(1)(e) of the IRPA \\nand s. 159.3 of the IRPR, the challenge was improperly constituted.  \\n[28] Despite allowing the appeal on this basis, the Court of Appeal addressed \\ncertain substantive s.  7 issues. First, it noted that the Federal Court judge erred in \\n \\nSecond, the court rejected the finding that the scheme’s safety valves were “illusory” \\n(para. 144). Third, the court found error with the Federal Court judge’s analysis of \\nAmerican dete ntion conditions (para.  146). Fourth, it also perceived errors in her \\nanalysis of the principles of fundamental justice. For the Court of Appeal, there was \\n“no evidence that could support a finding that the treatment of returnees to the United \\nStates at the Canada-United States border ‘shocks the conscience’” (para. 161). In any \\nevent, the court considered the scheme to be neither overbroad nor grossly \\ndisproportionate.  \\n[29] The Court of Appeal found it unnecessary to address the substance of the \\ns. 15 claim. H ad it been necessary, the court wrote that “[w]here, as here, no factual \\nfindings have been made on the section 15 issues, it is generally best for us to send the \\nmatter back to the Federal Court because of its expertise in fact-finding” (para. 173). \\nIV. Issues \\n[30] The appellants raise three issues: Is s. 159.3 of the IRPR ultra vires? Does \\ns. 159.3 unjustifiably breach s.  7 of the Charter? Should the s.  15 Charter claim be \\nremitted to the Federal Court or decided based on the record on appeal? \\nV. Statutory and Regulatory Scheme and Context \\n[31] The impugned regulation is part of the legislative scheme that implements \\n \\nAgreement. While not itself challenged, this treaty shapes the interpretation of its \\nimplementing scheme (see National Corn Growers Assn. v. Canada (Import Tribunal), \\n[1990] 2 S.C.R. 1324, at p. 1371). It is useful to examine the treaty and the legislation \\nin turn, as they remain substantively distinct under Canada’s “dualist system” for the \\napplication of international legal instruments ( Kazemi Estate v. Islamic Republic of \\nIran, 2014 SCC 62, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 176, at para.  150; see G.  van Ert, Using \\nInternational Law in Canadian Courts (2nd ed. 2008), ch. 7). An additi onal protocol \\nto the treaty has been signed and the implementing legislation has been amended since \\nthe hearing ( Regulations Amending the Immigration and Refugee Protection \\nRegulations (Examination of Eligibility to Refer Claim) , SOR/2023 -58; Additional \\nProtocol to the Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of \\nthe United States of America for cooperation in the examination of refugee status \\nclaims from nationals of third countries , March  24, 2023 (online)). I refrain from \\ncommenting on these instruments as they do not directly affect the substance of the \\nissues on appeal before the Court. \\nA. Safe Third Country Agreement \\n[32] About 30 years ago, Canada and the United States undertook the \\nnegotiation of an agreement to share responsibility for r efugee status claims. The \\nCanadian Council for Refugees, Amnesty International and the United Nations High \\n \\ncomments resulted in substantive amendments to a draft of the Safe Third Count ry \\nAgreement. The two states signed the agreement in 2002.  \\n[33] The preamble to the agreement expressly acknowledges the governments’ \\ninternational obligations to refugees (paras.  1, 2 and  8). It also addresses the parties’ \\nshared determination to safeguard fo r each eligible claimant “access to a full and fair \\nrefugee status determination procedure” (para.  8) and emphasizes that both countries \\noffer generous refugee protection systems (para.  4). Accompanying the treaty  is a \\nStatement of Principles associated with its implementation, which states that the parties \\nintend to abide by principles that include safeguards for claimants, such as the \\nopportunity for claimants to have a third party present during proceedings (Procedural \\nissues associated with implementing the Agreement for cooperation in the examination \\nof refugee status claims from nationals of third countries: Statement of Principles , \\nAugust 30, 2002 (online)). \\n[34] The principle animating the Safe Third Country Agreement  is that “the \\ncountry of last presence  shall examine, in accordance with its refugee status \\ndetermination system, the refugee status claim of any person who arrives at a land \\nborder port of entry” (Article  4(1)). This is the “crux” of the treaty (A.  Macklin, \\n“Disappearing Refugees: Reflections  on the Canada -U.S. Safe Third Country \\nAgreement” (2005), 36 Colum. Hum. Rts. L. Rev.  365, at p.  371) or its “general \\nprinciple” (S.  Baglay and M.  Jones, Refugee Law (2nd ed. 2017), at p.  279). The \\n \\nwhich the refugee claimant was physically present immediately prior to making a \\nrefugee status claim at a land border port of entry” (Article  1(1)(a)). The parties \\ncommitted to reviewing the agreement and to inviting the UNHCR to participate in the \\nfirst review (Article 8(3)).  \\n[35] While Article 4(1) sets out a broad principle, the treaty is limited in its \\napplication. To begin, the governments sought to ensure that “indirect” or “chain” \\nrefoulement would not occur. They agreed tha t individuals returned to Canada or the \\nUnited States would not be removed therefrom until that country had adjudicated the \\nindividual’s refugee status claim (Article  3). They also did not seek to apply the \\nagreement to citizens or habitual residents of ei ther country (Article  2) and provided \\nfor exceptions for unaccompanied minors and family reunification (Article 4(2)).  \\n[36] Even when the principle articulated in Article 4(1) would apply, the parties \\nagreed that there should be an authority to exempt claimant s. Article 6 provides that \\n“either Party may at its own discretion examine any refugee status claim made to that \\nParty where it determines that it is in its public interest to do so”. \\nB. Domestic Implementation of the Safe Third Country Agreement \\n[37] Section 101(1)(e) of the IRPA implements the core principle of the Safe \\nThird Country Agreement  by providing that the claims of individuals who “came \\ndirectly or indirectly to Canada from a country designated by the regulations, other than \\n \\nreferred to the Refugee Protection Division. This gives domestic effect to the principle \\nset out in Article 4(1) that an individual’s country of last presence will examine their \\nrefugee status claim. Various other rules in the IRPA and its regulations affect the \\napplication of this “general rule”, including (1) designation and review mechanisms; \\n(2) limits to the scope of the general rule; and (3) exemptions.  \\n(1) Designation and Review Mechanisms \\n[38] The IRPA sets forth the relevant  criteria for when a country may be \\ndesignated by the Governor in Council under s. 101(1)(e). Only countries that comply \\nwith the non-refoulement obligations under the relevant international conventions are \\neligible:  \\n102 (1) The regulations may govern matters relating to the application of \\nsections 100 and 101 . . . and, for the purpose of sharing responsibility with \\ngovernments of foreign states for the consideration of refugee claims, may \\ninclude provisions \\n \\n(a) designating countries that comply with Article 33 of the Refugee \\nConvention and Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture; \\n[39] Section 102(2) lists factors to be considered when ascertaining whether a \\ncountry complies with refugee protection standards mandated by the Conventions: \\n(2) The following factors are to be considered in designating a country \\nunder paragraph (1)(a): \\n \\n(a) whether the country is a party to the Refugee Convention and to the \\n \\n \\n(b) its policies and practices with respect to claims under the Refugee \\nConvention and with respect to obligations under the Convention \\nAgainst Torture; \\n \\n(c) its human rights record; and \\n \\n(d) whether it is party to an agreement with the Government of Canada \\nfor the purpose of sharing responsibility with respect to claims for \\nrefugee protection. \\n[40] The Governor in Council “must ensure the continuing review” of the \\ns. 102(2) factors with respect to each designated country (s. 102(3)). The United States \\nis the only country that has been designated ( Regulations Amending the Immigration \\nand Refugee Protection Regulations , SOR/2004 -217). Section  159.3 of the IRPR, \\nwhich the appellants challenge, provides: \\n159.3 The United States is designated under paragraph 102(1)(a) of the Act \\nas a country that complies with Article 33 of the Refugee Convention and \\nArticle 3 of the Convention Against Torture, and is a designated country \\nfor the purpose of the application of paragraph 101(1)(e) of the Act. \\n(2) Limits to the General Ineligibility Rule \\n[41] Various provisions in the  IRPR narrow the application of the ineligibility \\nrule by ensuring that not all refugee claimants arriving from the United States are \\nreturned there. The regulations  do this in two ways. First, the regulations contain \\nlimitations that closely track the contours of Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the Safe Third \\nCountry Agreement . For instance, under the regime considered in this appeal, \\n \\nports of entry — not elsewhere along the land border, by ship or by air (IRPR, s. 159.4). \\nThere are specific exceptions for individuals with family in Canada, to facilitate family \\nreunification (s.  159.5(a) to  (d)). As the treaty contemplates, these exceptions are  \\napplied according to Canada’s domestic understanding of the family (Article  1(2); \\nIRPR, s. 159.1). There are also exceptions for unaccompanied minors (s. 159.5(e)) and \\nfor individuals who have certain Canadian immigration statuses (s.  159.5(f) and (g)). \\nFinally, the regulations ensure that certain individuals whose claims will not be \\nadjudicated in the United States can access the Canadian system (s. 159.5(h)).  \\n[42] Second, the regulations include an exception reflecting Canada’s \\ndiscretion, preserved under Article 6 of the treaty, to consider claims when doing so is \\nin its public interest (Baglay and Jones, at p.  279). Section 159.6 of the IRPR ensures \\nthat claimants who establish that they have been charged with, or convicted of, an \\noffence punishable by the death penalty in the United States or another country are not \\nreturned.  \\n(3) Exemptions From the Application of the General Ineligibility Rule \\n[43] Individuals subject to the provisions implementing the Safe Third Country \\nAgreement cannot access some of the statuto ry mechanisms available to claimants in \\ndifferent circumstances. For instance, returnees are not eligible for a pre -removal risk \\nassessment before they are removed ( IRPA, s. 112(2)(b)). Further, there is no \\nadministrative appeal body set out in the IRPA for them. Judicial review at the Federal \\n \\nsuch proceedings are ongoing ( Federal Courts Rules , SOR/98 -106, r.  373; see also \\nBaglay and Jones, at pp. 354-57).  \\n[44] The IRPA does, however, contain mechanisms for temporary or permanent \\nexemptions from return to the United States (see, e.g., H.  Mayrand and \\nA. Smith-Grégoire, “À la croisée du chemin Roxham et de la rhétorique politique: \\ndémystifier l’Entente sur les tiers pays sûrs” (2018), 48 R.D.U.S. 321, at p. 342). First, \\nofficers may grant an administrative deferral from the enforcement of a removal order. \\nThis authority flows from s. 48(2) of the IRPA, which requires that removal orders be \\nenforced “as soon as possible”. Courts have held that this provision leaves officers with \\ndiscretion to delay the enforcement of a removal order (see, e.g., Atawnah v. Canada \\n(Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2016 FCA 144, [2017] 1 F.C.R. 153, at \\nparas. 13-18; Revell v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FCA 262, [2020] \\n2 F.C.R. 355, at para. 50; Tapambwa, at para. 87). In this case, ABC and her daughters \\nbenefitted from an administrative deferral of  removal, during which their counsel \\napplied for a stay of removal. \\n[45] Second, officers may grant a temporary resident permit. This authority \\nflows from s. 24 of the IRPA, which allows an officer to issue a permit if they are “of \\nthe opinion that it is justified in the circumstances”. The Minister or their delegate may \\nalso make instructions to guide officers in determining when to issue such permits \\n(s. 24(3)). Here, Ms. Al Nahass’s family received temporary resident permits while the \\n \\n[46] Third, the Minister may grant an exemption based on humanitarian and \\ncompassionate grounds, as occurred for Ms.  Al Nahass’s family. The Minister may \\nexempt certain foreign nationals who are inadmissible from any of the requirements of \\nthe IRPA. They may grant exemptions where they view doing so as “justified by \\nhumanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to the foreign national, taking \\ninto account the best interests of a child directly affected” (s. 25.1(1)). This assessment \\nmust “consider and give weight to all relevant humanitarian and compassionate \\nconsiderations in a particular case” ( Kanthasamy v. Canada (Citizenship and \\nImmigration), 2015 SCC 61, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 909, at para. 33 (emphasis in original)).  \\n[47] Fourth, the Minister has a further discretion to exempt foreign nationals \\nwho are inadmissible from any of the requirements of the IRPA. The Minister may do \\nso when they are “of the opinion that it is justified by public policy considerations” \\n(s. 25.2(1)). The respondents observe that this provision permits the Minister to \\nestablish a temporary public policy exempting individuals who are part of a specified \\ngroup from the ineligibility provision. \\n[48] Any removal order against a foreign national can be stayed wh ile the \\nMinister makes their decision in relation to s. 25.1(1) or 25.2(1) (IRPR, s. 233).  \\nVI. Administrative Law Issues \\n[49] I turn now to the appellants’ argument that s.  159.3 of the IRPR is ultra \\n \\nauthority to maintain a designation. First, the appellants submit that it was \\nunreasonable, given the factors in s.  102 of the IRPA, to maintain the United States’ \\ndesignation when there is evidence that many refugees cannot access ef fective \\nprotection there. Second, they say that the Governor in Council breached its s.  102(3) \\nobligation to ensure continuing review of the United States’ compliance.  \\n[50] I would not give effect to these arguments. I agree with the respondents \\nthat the vires of s. 159.3 of the IRPR must be examined at the time of promulgation. \\n[51] Regulations “derive their validity from the statute which creates the power, \\nand not from the executive body by which they are made” (Reference as to the Validity \\nof the Regulations in relation to Chemicals , [1943] S.C.R. 1, at p.  13, per Duff C.J., \\nquoting The Zamora, [1916] 2 A.C. 77 (P.C.), at p.  90). The limits imposed by the \\nenabling statute are therefore fundamental to determining whether a regulation is intra \\nvires (see J. M. Keyes, Executive Legislation (3rd ed. 2021), at p. 165).  \\n[52] Here, the appellants misconstrue the limitations imposed by s.  102 of the \\nIRPA. The Governor in Council may promulgate regulations “designating countries \\nthat comply with Article 33 of the Refugee Convention and Article 3 of the Convention \\nAgainst Torture” (s. 102(1)(a)). The statute also prescribes factors for the Governor in \\nCouncil to consider “in designating a country” (s. 102(2)). These factors concern when \\ncountries may be designated. Thus, s.  102(1)(a) and  (2) establishes conditions \\nprecedent to designation for the purposes of s. 101(1)(e), as the Federal Court of Appeal \\n \\nnot after, a country is designated (see E. A. Driedger, “Subordinate Legislation” \\n(1960), 38 Can. Bar Rev. 1, at p. 8). \\n[53] The Governor in Council does, however, have statutory obligations in the \\nperiod after a country is designated pursuant to s. 102(1)(a). Section 102(3) creates an \\nobligation to “ensure the continuing review” of the s. 102(2) factors. These reviews are \\nnot directed at whether the regulation exceeds the limits imposed by the statute, which \\nis the proper focus of a vires challenge. In this sense, the s. 102(3) reviews are outside \\nthe scope of a challenge alleging that s.  159.3 of the IRPR is ultra vires the IRPA. \\nInstead, the continuing reviews are a distinct statutory obligation of the Governor in \\nCouncil. As a result, s. 102(3) reviews may be challenged based on administrative law \\nprinciples (see C.A. reasons, at para. 96). However, the appellants did not seek judicial \\nreview of particular s. 102(3) reviews conducted after the promulgation of s. 159.3.  \\n[54] Focusing on the appropriate date and recognizing that the s. 102(3) reviews \\nare outside the scope of a vires argument, I am persuaded that the appellants fail on this \\npoint. As this Court has held, “[r]egulations benefit from a presumption of validity” \\n(Katz Group Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Health and Long -Term Care), 2013 SCC 64, \\n[2013] 3 S.C.R. 810, at para.  25; see also P. -A. Côté and M.  Devinat, Interprétation \\ndes lois (5th ed. 2021), at para.  1314). Thus, to succeed in their argument based on \\ns. 159.3’s inconsistency with the provisions they rely on, the appellants must show that \\non the date of promulgation, the designation of the United States was not authorized by \\n \\npost-promulgation developments, the appellants have not done so. Accordingly, the \\nappellants’ submission that s. 159.3 of the IRPR is ultra vires should be rejected.  \\n[55] As a result, addressing other aspects of the appellants’ administrative law \\nclaims is unnecessary, including the appropriate standard of review and how that \\nstandard would be applied in the circumstances of this case.  \\nVII. The Section 7 Claim  \\n[56] To establish a violation of s. 7 of the Charter, challengers must first show \\nthat the impugned legislation deprives them of life, liberty or security of the person. \\nThis analysis asks whether the legislation “engage[s]” those interests, in the sense that \\nit causes a limitation or negative impact on, an infringement of, or an interference with \\nthem (Carter, at para. 55; see also Bedford, at paras. 57-58, 90 and 111). A risk of such \\na deprivation suffices (see, e.g., Carter, at para. 62; R. v. Malmo-Levine, 2003 SCC 74, \\n[2003] 3 S.C.R. 571, at para.  89; Suresh, at para. 27). Second, challengers must show \\nthat the deprivation is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. \\n[57] The appellants say that the Federal Court judge’s findings were grounded \\nin the evidence, which demonstrates that s.  159.3 of the IRPR causes deprivations of \\nliberty and security of the person. They say these deprivatio ns are not consistent with \\nthe applicable principles of fundamental justice: overbreadth and gross \\n \\ndeprivations accord with the principles of fundamental justice and, in any  event, the \\nFederal Court judge found that these safeguards are illusory.  \\n[58] In my respectful view, the Federal Court judge made errors at both stages \\nof her s.  7 analysis. The legislative scheme engages s.  7 in some, but not all, of the \\nrespects she identif ied. Moreover, it does accord with the principles of fundamental \\njustice.  \\nA. Properly Constituting a Section 7 Challenge \\n[59] The parties agree that s. 159.3 of the IRPR was an appropriate target for a \\nCharter challenge. The Federal Court of Appeal had disagreed, holding that the claim \\nwas not properly constituted because it should have been directed at other forms of \\nstate action that are the “real cause” of any possible infringements. In particular, the \\ncourt concluded that the appellants should have targeted th e administrative reviews, \\nrequired by s.  102(3) of the IRPA, of the United States’ designation and related \\nadministrative conduct. In my respectful view, the Court of Appeal erred by \\nmisapplying the relevant Charter causation jurisprudence. \\n[60] This Court has long recognized that, to succeed, a Charter claim must show \\na causal link between state action and the violation of the relevant right or freedom \\n(see, e.g., Operation Dismantle Inc. v. The Queen , [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441, at p.  447, per \\nDickson J., as he then was). In Bedford, this Court held that a “sufficient causal \\n \\n“be the only or the dominant cause of the prejudice suffered by the claimant” (para. 76). \\nAs a result, the me re fact that other forms of state action may also have a causal \\nconnection to the harms alleged does not mean that a challenge to legislation — such \\nas s. 159.3 of the IRPR — is improperly constituted. \\n[61] The Court of Appeal dismissed the Charter challenges for failing to adhere \\nto two propositions it drew from this Court’s causation jurisprudence. First, challengers \\nshould not attack provisions in artificial isolation. Second, when administrative conduct \\nunder legislation is responsible for unconstitutional effects, that action or inaction must \\nbe challenged, not the legislation. While these two propositions do speak to important \\nconsiderations, in my respectful view they do not justify the conclusion that the \\nappellants’ challenge is improperly constituted. \\n(1) The Relevance of Preventative and Curative Measures to the Section  7 \\nChallenge \\n[62] Provisions in a complex, interrelated legislative scheme should not be \\nviewed in isolation. Generally, the constitutionality of these provisions can only be \\nevaluated by consider ing the entire scheme. However, this did not preclude the \\nappellants from targeting s. 159.3 of the IRPR.  \\n[63] When a Charter challenge targets a provision in an interrelated legislative \\nscheme, the potential impact of related provisions, including those that may serve to \\n \\n(emphasis added)). The success or failure of a Charter claim may turn on arguments or \\nevidence related to preventative or curative provisions. But this should rarely preclude \\nconsideration of whether life, liberty or security of the person under s. 7 are “engaged”. \\n[64] Legislation often implicates interests that s.  7 protects. At times, this will \\nresult from broad provisions that would — taken on their own — have constitutionally \\nrelevant effects on life, liberty or security of the person. However, legislatures can \\ninclude related provisions within a scheme that temper those effects. When these \\nmeasures are part of an integrated legislative whole, they must be acc ounted for when \\nassessing the constitutionality of rules of general application. \\n[65] In PHS, for example, this Court considered the linkages between a general \\nrule and provisions related to it. At issue was, among other things, a general statutory \\nprohibition on possession of controlled substances except as authorized under the \\nregulations. The statute gave the Minister the power “to issue exemptions for medical \\nor scientific reasons, or for any purpose the Minister deems to be in the public interest” \\nfrom the application of any provision of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. \\n1996, c. 19 (“CDSA”) (PHS, at para. 39). \\n[66] The Court found that exemptions acted “as a safety valve that prevents the \\n[statute] from applying where such application would be arbitrary, overbroad or grossly \\ndisproportionate in its effects” (PHS, at para. 113). In other words, when the Minister’s \\ndiscretion was exercised, these provisions cured the constitutional defects that would \\n \\nhave been caught by it: the staff and clients of a safe injection facility (paras.  94 \\nand 114).  \\n[67] Here, the Federal Court of Appeal rightly drew on PHS in stating that \\nrelated provisions in a legislative scheme may “prevent” or “cure” constitutional \\ndefects (C.A. reasons, at para.  58(a)). The exemptions discussed in PHS were \\n“curative” in that they made discretionary relief available to those who would otherwise \\nbe inappropriately subject to the general prohibition. In other words, the exemption \\nremedied the specific harm that would have flowed from the application of the general \\nrule.  \\n[68] Curative measures are thus remedial: they repair a breach that would be \\ncaused by a general rule by providing a targeted exemption after the fact (see PHS, at \\npara. 41). These measures often work together with preventative measures to limit the \\nscope of a provision of general application. Preventative measures narrow a general \\nrule by precluding its application in anticipation of a breach, often through legislative \\nexceptions. These categories are not watertight compartments, nor are they exhaustive. \\nMoreover, if a class of individuals habitually receive individualized exemptions after \\nthe fact, a legislature could enact a class-wide exception that applies in advance. \\n[69] Charter challenges need not target preventative and curative provisions \\nwhen the provision of general application to which they relate is a cause of the alleged \\nmischief. Following PHS, courts must consider legislative provisions in their entire \\n \\nscheme. Indeed, a failure to consider a relevant related provision can “undermine the \\nlegitimacy” of constitutional analysis (R. v. Parker (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.), at \\npara. 171, per Rosenberg J.A.).  \\n[70] In the legislative scheme at issue in this case, examples of preventative \\nmeasures include the death penalty exception in s.  159.6 of the IRPR and the various \\nfamily reunification exceptions in s.  159.5(a) to  (d). Curative measures include the \\navailability of temporary resident permits under s. 24, humanitarian and compassionate \\nexemptions under s. 25.1(1), and public policy exceptions under s. 25.2(1).  \\n[71] At the engagement stage, preventative provisions can tailor a provision of \\ngeneral application so carefully that it never threatens s.  7 interests. For instance, \\ns. 159.6 of the IRPR prevents the threat to life that might emerge from returning \\nindividuals subject to the death penalty. In so doing, preventative provisions like \\ns. 159.6 rule out certain s. 7 engagements. By contrast, curative provisions will rarely, \\nif ever, preclude the engagement of s.  7. PHS provides direct support for this \\nproposition, as this Court held that the general prohibition on possession engaged s.  7 \\ndespite the availability of safety valves. Curative provisions create exceptional \\ndepartures from a general rule; they are typically available only after a determination \\nthat the general rule applies. The possibility of obtaining an exemption is therefore a \\npath through which the risks the general rule poses to life, liberty or security of the \\nperson can sometimes be avoided. In such cases, the threat to the s. 7 interests persists, \\n \\n[72] Some have suggested that because curative mechanisms are available, \\nrefugee claimants’ s.  7 interests are not engaged at the exclusion or inadmissibility \\ndetermination stage. This assertion rests on a statement in B010 v. Canada (Citizenship \\nand Immigration), 2015 SCC 58, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 704, that it is at the “subsequent \\npre-removal risk assessment stage of the IRPA’s refugee protection process that s. 7 is \\ntypically engaged” rather than earlier stages (para.  75). This comment in B010 relied \\non a passage from Febles, which spoke to the Charter-compliance of an exclusion \\nprovision in the IRPA. Some scholars have criticized this view of curative mechanisms’ \\nrole in engagement, saying that dicta from these cases should not deflect analysis from \\nthis Court’s approach to s.  7 engagement established in other contexts (see Heckman, \\nat p. 313; C. Grey, “Thinkable: The Charter and Refugee Law after Appulonappa and \\nB010” (2016), 76 S.C.L.R. (2d) 111, at pp.  131-35 and  139; s ee also H.  Stewart, \\nFundamental Justice: Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  \\n(2nd ed. 2019), at pp. 77-81 and 342).  \\n[73] Febles stated that an exclusion provision was “consistent” with s.  7 of the \\nCharter (para. 67). In line with Bedford and PHS, Febles should not be read as \\nconflating the engagement and the principles of fundamental justice stages of the s.  7 \\nanalysis. As for B010, I observe that this Court ordered a new hearing in that appeal as \\na matter of statutory interpretation and found it unnecessary to consider the appellants’ \\ns. 7 challenge (para. 74). The brief comment that it is only at the pre-removal stage that \\n“s. 7 is typically engaged” was neither a formal statement of the law nor necessary to \\n \\non s. 7 engagement. It is helpful to recall that in other contexts, such as extradition, s. 7 \\n“permeates” the entire process and is “engaged, although for different purposes” at each \\nstage of the proc eedings (United States of America v. Cobb , 2001 SCC 19, [2001] 1 \\nS.C.R. 587, at para. 34, per Arbour J.). In the context of ineligibility under s. 101(1)(e) \\nof the IRPA, where curative measures are key to the s.  7 analysis, such measures are \\nthus best understood as relevant to the principles of fundamental justice rather than to \\nthe threshold question of engagement, in keeping with this Court’s methodology in \\nBedford (see, e.g., Heckman, at pp. 347-56).  \\n[74] Turning to the principles of fundamental justice anal ysis, the role of \\npreventative provisions will vary depending on which principles are at issue. For \\nexample, legislative tailoring determines how broadly the general regime will be \\napplied and thus undoubtedly factors into whether a scheme is overbroad.  \\n[75] The parties disagree as to how curative measures bear on this case. In line \\nwith this Court’s reasoning in PHS, the respondents appear to see curative measures — \\nlike humanitarian and compassionate exemptions — as relevant to determining whether \\nthe principles of fundamental justice are respected. Conversely, the appellants claim \\nthat Bedford’s highly individualistic focus on “whether anyone’s life, liberty or security \\nof the person has been denied” has overtaken PHS on this point (para. 123 (emphasis \\nin ori ginal)). They say that discretionary exemptions now only factor into the s.  1 \\n \\n[76] I disagree with the appellants. Curative mechanisms are properly \\nconsidered when assessing whether a deprivation comports with the principles of \\nfundamental justice. Bedford did not hold otherwise. Indeed, curative mechanisms \\nwere not at issue in Bedford, so it was unnecessary for this Court to comment on how \\nits approach interacted with its reasoning in PHS. In my view, Bedford and PHS are \\ncompatible. Curative provision s have taken on increased significance in the wake of \\nBedford’s recognition that a regime that is rational and non -arbitrary in almost all \\ncircumstances can nonetheless violate s.  7 if it is arbitrary, overbroad or grossly \\ndisproportionate for one individual (para. 123). If the legislature has crafted a scheme \\nthat cures potential breaches by providing exemptions that can target the specific \\ndeprivations, this can render the legislative scheme Charter-compliant (see D. Moore, \\n“Engagement with Human Rights by Administrative Decision -Makers: A \\nTransformative Opportunity to Build a More Grassroots Human Rights Culture” \\n(2017), 49 Ottawa L. Rev. 131, at pp. 150-51; see also PHS, at para. 114). In this sense, \\nthe focus of the s.  7 analysis is, at most, only “highly individualistic” when the \\nlegislature has not provided mechanisms that individualize the law’s effects (Stewart \\n(2019), at p. 150; see also C. Fehr, “Rethinking the Instrumental Rationality Principles \\nof Fundamental Justice” (2020), 58 Alta. L. Rev.  133). However, as in PHS, the \\nexemption mechanism must be responsive to the specific deprivation that is the subject \\nof the Charter challenge.  \\n[77] I note that the Court of Appeal viewed the availability of judicial review in \\n \\nestablished by Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC \\n65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, and this Court’s broader administrative law jurisprudence, \\njudicial review helps ensure that public authorities respect “legal limits, derived from \\nthe enabling statute itself, the common or civil law or the Consti tution” (Dunsmuir v. \\nNew Brunswick , 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, at para.  28). However, judicial \\nreview offers different relief than a statutory mechanism that prevents or cures defects \\nthat would arise from the isolated operation of a general rule. Th is is because \\nlegislatures can never entirely “shield administrative decision making from curial \\nscrutiny” (Vavilov, at para.  24). The general availability of judicial review therefore \\ncannot save otherwise unconstitutional legislation. For this reason, I consider it \\nunhelpful to view judicial review as a form of “safety valve” or statutory safeguard. \\n[78] In sum, preventative and curative provisions are both relevant in different \\nways to the appellants’ Charter claim. To assess a s.  7 breach, the presence of su ch \\nmechanisms must be considered. However, the appellants did not need to target these \\nprovisions to constitute their challenge. \\n(2) The Relevance of Associated Administrative Conduct to the Section  7 \\nChallenge \\n[79] I now turn to the question of whether the appellants were obliged to target \\nadministrative conduct rather that the legislation. The Court of Appeal said that \\n“subsection 102(3) reviews and related administrative conduct”, which could have led \\n \\nof the challenge (para.  61). The appellants dispute this conclusion, submitting that \\nwhatever the result of the s.  102(3) reviews should have been, “the fact remains that \\nthe law on the books (s. 159.3 IRPR) is the cause of the Charter breaches in issue and \\nis therefore the proper object of Charter scrutiny and s.  52 [of the Constitution Act, \\n1982] relief” (A.F., at para. 34). \\n[80] I agree with the appellants that it was open to them to challenge s. 159.3 of \\nthe IRPR, rather than administrative conduct, and seek a declaration that the provision \\nis of no force or effect because it is inconsistent with the Charter. While other avenues \\nmay have been available — such as challenging the conduct of the s. 102(3) reviews or \\nseeking individual relief from adverse administrative decisions related to the s.  24, \\n25.1(1), 25.2(1) or 48(2) curative mechanisms — the appellants did not have to pursue \\nthese alternatives to properly constitute their Charter claim.  \\n[81] To understand why the appellants were n ot obliged to target the s.  102(3) \\nreviews, it is necessary to examine their role within the overall legislative scheme. The \\ns. 102(3) reviews are not safety valves. Safety valves, as referred to in the ss. 7 and 12 \\nCharter jurisprudence, typically mean di scretionary exemptions or other curative \\nmechanisms, rather than preventative provisions ( e.g., PHS, at para.  113; Chaoulli v. \\nQuebec (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 35, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 791, at para. 224, per Binnie \\nand LeBel JJ., dissenting; R. v. Lloyd, 2016 SCC 13, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 130, at para.  36, \\nper McLachlin C.J.). The reviews do not play a curative role, as they do not make after-\\n \\npreventative measures, which preclude the application of a general rule, often through \\nlegislative exceptions. \\n[82] Section 102(3) of the IRPA requires the Governor in Council to ensure the \\ncontinuing review of the s.  102(2) factors, such as the designated country’s human \\nrights record. The reviews conducted to date have left the designation in place, which \\nremains the legislative basis for the ineligibility of claims advanced by the individual \\nappellants. While the administrative conduct that led to the designation being \\nmaintained may also be sus ceptible to constitutional challenge in its own right, the \\nexistence of this alternative does not insulate s.  159.3 of the IRPR from Charter \\nscrutiny. Similarly, while the appellants might also have challenged administrative \\ndecisions pertaining to the applicability of exceptions or the availability of exemptions, \\nthis does not preclude challenges to s. 159.3.  \\nB. Engagement of Section 7 Interests \\n[83] In light of the foregoing, the appellants’ challenge was properly \\nconstituted. I now turn to the substantive s. 7 Charter analysis. While the parties agree \\nthat s. 159.3 of the IRPR engages s. 7, they disagree on the particulars of each alleged \\ndeprivation and their causal connections to Canadian state action. The first stage of the \\ns. 7 analysis makes clear that the Federal Court judge was right that s.  159.3 engages \\nliberty and security of the person. But in my respectful view, she erred in her \\n \\n[84] The respondents rightly acknowledge that assessing the constitutional \\nimplications of effects that materialize in other countries does not amount to applying \\nthe Charter to foreign governments. Here, the challenge is directed at the legislative \\nscheme, which is undoubtedly state action that attracts Charter scrutiny. There is no \\nplace in this analysis for assessing whether American laws, policies or actions \\nthemselves comply with the Charter. Canadian courts only consider deprivations  \\n“effected by actors other than our government, if there is a sufficient causal connection \\nbetween our governmen t’s participation and the deprivation ultimately effected” \\n(Suresh, at para.  54). Canada cannot “avoid the guarantee of fundamental justice \\nmerely because the deprivation in question would be effected by someone else’s hand” \\n(ibid.; see also Canada v. Schm idt, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 500, at p.  522; United States v. \\nBurns, 2001 SCC 7, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 283, at paras. 59-60; India v. Badesha, 2017 SCC \\n44, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 127, at para.  38). But the focus remains fixed on the Canadian \\nlegislative scheme and its effects. \\n(1) Effects Implicating Section 7 Interests \\n[85] The appellants’ liberty and security of the person submissions focus on \\ndetention in the United States and the risks that claimants may be refouled to their \\ncountries of origin following their return to the United S tates. These arguments have \\nboth factual and legal aspects. Whether an alleged effect exists is a question of fact, \\nwhile the scope of a s.  7 interest is a question of law. The standard of review for the \\n \\n2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para.  10; Bedford, at para.  56; Carter, at \\npara. 109). The standard of review for the legal questions is correctness ( Housen, at \\npara. 8).  \\n(a) Detention in the United States \\n[86] The appellants argue that all returnees face a risk of detention in the United \\nStates. They allege that this risk is especially pressing for individuals without status \\nthere and that those under a removal order are certain to be detained. Further, they claim \\nthat the Fe deral Court judge’s findings did not turn on her references to “automatic” \\ndetention. In any event, “automatic” refers to detention that is imposed without \\nconsideration, as a mechanistic or reflexive result and, as such, is not an error.  \\n[87] With respect, th e Federal Court judge’s references to “automatic” \\ndetention were erroneous. The evidence shows that detention is not automatic and \\nreturnees’ risks of detention vary on a case -by-case basis. In my view, this palpable \\nerror overwhelmed the Federal Court judge’s conclusions on detention. I agree with the \\nrespondents and the Court of Appeal that detention is not automatic, in the sense that it \\nis not universally applied: for the broad class comprising all returnees, the “highest \\npossible finding on this record  is that returnees to the United States are exposed to a \\nrisk of discretionary detention . . . [as] returnees who are detained in the United States \\ncan seek release and release is often granted, either on bond or without” (C.A. reasons, \\n \\n[88] It is true that the respondents’ expert acknowledged that there are certain \\ncategories of individuals for whom detention is automatic or mandatory: those whom \\nAmerican law defines as arriving or criminal aliens; individuals subject to a final \\nremoval order; and suspected terrorists (Affidavit of Stephen  Yale-Loehr, at \\nparas. 135-41, reproduced in A.R., vol.  XLVII, at pp. 20144-45). But the record does \\nnot demonstrate that these categories apply to those returned pursuant to the Safe Third \\nCountry Agree ment. For other categories of non -citizens, the appellants did not \\nseriously dispute that detention is discretionary and subject to the possibility of release \\n(ibid., at paras.  131-34; Cross -examination of Anwen  Hughes, questions  143-49, \\nreproduced in A.R., vol. XXVII, at pp. 11291-92). Indeed, Ms. Mustefa and all of the \\nanonymized affiants who answered written cross-examinations were offered release on \\nbond, and all but one were released. The record also suggests that other alternatives to \\ndetention are available (Affidavit of Yale-Loehr, at paras. 159-62). Thus, the evidence \\ndoes not support the Federal Court judge’s finding that detention is “automatic”, in the \\nordinary sense of the word.  \\n[89] While returnees do not face automatic detention in the United Stat es, the \\nrisk of detention remains an effect that engages liberty. This Court has repeatedly held \\nthat “liberty” encompasses freedom from detention, imprisonment and the threat \\nthereof (R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, at p. 652; R. v. Swain, [1991] 1 S.C.R. \\n933, at p.  969; Winko v. British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute) , [1999] 2 \\n \\nThus, because the question at the engagement stage is simply whether the a ppellants \\nhave demonstrated an effect within the scope of s. 7, a risk of detention suffices.  \\n(b) Conditions While Detained in the United States \\n[90] The appellants also argue that conditions of detention in the United States \\nimplicate the security of the person i nterest, as the Federal Court judge held. To be \\nsure, security of the person protects against physical punishment or suffering and the \\nthreat thereof (Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177, \\nat p. 207; Suresh, at paras. 53-55). It also protects against serious and profound state -\\nimposed psychological stress ( New Brunswick (Minister of Health and Community \\nServices) v. G.  (J.), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 46, at para.  60). The respondents have failed to \\nshow reversible errors in the Federal Court judge’s determination that the conditions of \\ndetention fall, in certain respects, within the scope of the security of the person interest.  \\n[91] First, the Federal Court judge found that the “use of solitary confinement” \\nraised the security of the person  interest (para.  110). Ms.  Mustefa and one of the \\nanonymized affiants stated that they were isolated pending the results of tuberculosis \\ntests. The Federal Court judge’s heavy reliance on this evidence suggests that she \\nreached her conclusion on solitary c onfinement with respect to its uses for this public \\nhealth purpose. Thus, as I understand her finding, she concluded that isolation is used \\nwhile some returnees are awaiting tuberculosis testing. This finding discloses no \\nreviewable error. I have no hesita tion in concluding that the use of medical isolation \\n \\n“solitary confinement”. Whether these risks accord with the principles of fundamental \\njustice, or are otherwise justified, is not the question at this stage. \\n[92] Second, the Federal Court judge also accepted evidence that certain \\ndetention centres were “abnormally cold” (para.  111). She relied, in support of this \\nconclusion, on four affiants who had themselves experienced co ld conditions in \\ndetention. Ms. Mustefa says that her detention facility was “freezing cold” and that, \\nduring the day, she had to put socks over her hands and arms to stay warm, while curled \\nup under a towel. I see no reversible error in the conclusion that this level of cold could \\ncause physical suffering, which engages security of the person. \\n[93] Third, the Federal Court judge concluded that the medical care provided in \\nthe detention facilities was inadequate in certain respects (para. 112). For instance, she \\nnoted evidence that medical staff would ignore Black detainees while addressing White \\ndetainees’ medical issues ( ibid.). No reversible error has been shown in her factual \\nfindings on inadequacies in medical care, nor in her conclusion that these effects f all \\nwithin the scope of the security of the person interest (para. 114).  \\n[94] Fourth, the Federal Court judge noted two other portions of Ms. Mustefa’s \\naffidavit. In particular, Ms.  Mustefa said that while detained in the United States, her \\nreligious dietary restrictions were not respected and she was held alongside individuals \\nwho had been criminally convicted (para. 96). The appellants reference these forms of \\ntreatment, even though the Federal Court judge did not rely on them in her analysis of \\n \\nfindings below, that this treatment falls within the scope of security of the person. \\nHowever, as will become plain, even taking the appellants’ case on this point at its \\nhighest, I would find no breach of s. 7 on this basis.  \\n(c) Risks of Refoulement From the United States \\n[95] The appellants also argue that returnees are at a real and not speculative \\nrisk of being refouled from the United States to their countries of origin, as the Federal \\nCourt judge held. Returning individuals to the United States does not itself constitute \\nrefoulement, nor does the United States returning individuals to their countries of origin \\nif the relevant international obligations are respected. Rather, the concern i s that the \\nUnited States may be returning individuals contrary to those obligations, thereby \\nmaking Canada a participant in indirect refoulement when it returns refugee claimants \\nto the United States. The appellants  claim that this risk implicates security  of the \\nperson. There is no question that a risk of refoulement — whether directly from Canada \\nor indirectly after return to a third country — falls within the scope of the security of \\nthe person interest. This Court has noted that the non-refoulement principle is “the \\ncornerstone of the international refugee protection regime” ( Németh v. Canada \\n(Justice), 2010 SCC 56, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 281, at para.  18). By definition, refoulement \\nexposes individuals to threats to their life or freedom (Refugee Convention, Article 33), \\ntorture ( Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading \\nTreatment or Punishment , Can. T.S. 1987 No.  36, Article 3) or other serious human \\n \\nin Singh considered it “unthinkable” that refoulement would fall outside the scope of \\ns. 7’s protections (p. 210).  \\n[96] In this case, the more difficult question at the s. 7 engagement stage is the \\nfactual one: whether the Federal Court judge erred in concl uding that a real and not \\nspeculative risk of refoulement from the United States exists. As I will explain, so said \\nmost respectfully, the Federal Court judge made reviewable errors on this point. \\n(i) Refoulement Because of Barriers Caused by Detention Conditions \\n[97] The appellants argue that the Federal Court judge was right to find that a \\nrisk of refoulement flows from the barriers to making an asylum claim while detained \\n(Federal Court reasons, at para.  106). The r espondents submit that the record cannot \\nsupport this conclusion and that Canadian courts should presume that foreign processes \\nfor determining asylum claims are fair. The respondents also invoke a presumption of \\ncompliance with international obligations and say that the standard for displacing this \\npresumption with respect to the United States is that “the evidence must demonstrate \\nextraordinary circumstances and impeach the totality of the system, even casting doubt \\non the independence of the judiciary” ( R.F., at para. 89; see also transcript, at pp. 89 \\nand 92).  \\n[98] The respondents’ arguments are overstated. It is true that there is a \\npresumption that foreign states have fair and independent judicial processes (Canada \\n \\nEmployment and Immigration v. Satiacum  (1989), 99 N.R. 171 (F.C.A.), at para.  19). \\nBut I am not satisfied that courts should rely on a presumption that foreign states \\ncomply, in every respect, with international law. Instead, the ordinary principles for \\nCharter claims should be followed: the challengers must prove the facts substantiating \\nthe alleged rights violations connected to state action ascribed to Canada. When those \\nfactual findings are challenged, the ordinary  appellate standard of “palpable and \\noverriding error” applies.  \\n[99] Applying the proper standard, I am satisfied that the respondents have \\nshown a reviewable error. The record cannot support the Federal Court judge’s finding \\nthat barriers to advancing an asyl um claim while detained give rise to a “real and not \\nspeculative” risk of refoulement from the United States.  \\n[100] To begin, as the Court of Appeal noted, the Federal Court judge’s reasons \\ndid not squarely engage with significant evidence related to how asylum  claims are \\nadvanced while individuals are detained (para.  142). For instance, Ms.  Mustefa and \\nnearly all of the anonymized affiants had access to counsel to assist with their claims \\nwhile detained in the United States. Further, several of the expert affia nts \\nacknowledged widespread programs designed to provide free legal representation to \\nindividuals in immigration detention. Indeed, the record indicates that relevant \\nAmerican legislation offers guarantees of a right to counsel in asylum proceedings and \\nrequires claimants be given a list of pro bono counsel (see Affidavit of Yale -Loehr, at \\n \\nU.S.C. §  1158(d)(4)(B) (2018); see also Cross -examination of Hughes, \\nquestions 298-310). The Federal Court judge did not explicitly engage with this \\nimportant evidence in making her finding. In my respectful view, this omission “gives \\nrise to the reasoned belief that the trial judge must have forgotten, ignored or \\nmisconceived the evidence i n a way that affected [her] conclusion” ( Housen, at \\npara. 39, quoting Van de Perre v. Edwards , 2001 SCC 60, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 1014, at \\npara. 15). \\n[101] Further, the record does not support the Federal Court judge’s finding that \\nrefoulement flows from alleged barri ers to advancing a claim while detain ed. In this \\nrespect, two crucial matters went largely unaddressed. First, the record discloses review \\nand appeal mechanisms internal to the American asylum system (Affidavit of \\nYale-Loehr, at paras. 67-74). The appellants point to no evidence establishing that these \\nmechanisms are ineffective. Second, the record reveals that certain claimants whose \\nasylum applications fail have avenues for remaining in the United States. Among these \\nis temporary protected status, which p ermits individuals from designated countries to \\nremain (see, e.g., Cross-examination of Abed Ayoub, questions 236-60, reproduced in \\nA.R., vol. XXXI, at pp. 13012-17). Another avenue is “withholding of removal”, which \\nallows individuals to remain if they are more likely than not to be persecuted based on \\none of the grounds recognized in the Refugee Convention (see, e.g., Affidavit of \\nDeborah Anker, at paras.  65-67, reproduced in A.R., vol.  XVII, at pp.  7340-41). Yet \\nanother path is protection based on the Convention Against Torture  (see, e.g., ibid.). \\n \\nvictims of crime or trafficking (see, e.g., Cross -examination of Lenni  B. Benson, \\nquestions 278-82, 344 -47, 350 -55 and 513 -21, reproduced in A.R., vol.  XXVIII, at \\npp. 11604-5, 11621, 11623 and 11659-61). These mechanisms are relevant to whether \\nindividuals whose detention may create barriers to advancing their asylum claims are, \\nin the end, refouled. But the Federal Court judge did not assess these mechanisms.  \\n[102] Respectfully said, the Federal Court judge erred by not explicitly \\nconsidering these aspects of the record that undermine her finding. The record does not \\nsupport her conclusion that American detention conditions pose barrie rs to the \\nadvancement of asylum claims that raise a real and not speculative risk of refoulement. \\nWhile it is possible that barriers to advancing a claim in a third country could be so \\nhigh as to create such a risk, the appellants have not demonstrated that here.  \\n(ii) Refoulement Due to American Asylum Policies \\n[103] Before the Federal Court, the appellants also argued that the imposition of \\na “one-year bar” ( i.e., a rule under which asylum claims must be advanced within a \\nyear of a claimant’s arrival) and the restri ctive interpretation of gender -based \\npersecution as a basis for asylum each result in a risk of refoulement from the United \\nStates. They argued that the Canadian legislation facilitating the return of claimants to \\nthe United States, where those risks may m aterialize, implicates the security of the \\nperson interest. The Federal Court judge did not make any findings in connection with \\n \\nto advancing an asylum claim from detention (paras. 106 and 113). Indeed, she did not \\ncomment on the nature or scope of the relevant American policies. \\n[104] On appeal to this Court, the appellants invoke the purported risks of \\nrefoulement flowing from these aspects of American asylum law. However, they do \\nnot address how these policies operate and should be understood. Instead, they cite the \\nfindings of the Federal Court in Canadian Council for Refugees v. Canada , 2007 FC \\n1262, [2008] 3 F.C.R. 606, along with certain aspects of the evidence that was  before \\nthe Federal Court judge in the present case. The respondents, by contrast, argue that \\nthe relevant American policies respect the non-refoulement principle, relying on other \\nparts of the evidentiary record. \\n[105] In CCR (2008), the Federal Court of Appeal set aside the judgment of the \\nFederal Court, in part because the hypothetical nature of the challenge provided “no \\nfactual basis upon which to assess the alleged Charter breaches” (para.  103). More \\nimportantly, however, findings made in those proceedings are not properly before this \\nCourt here. The Federal Court’s 2007 findings are thus of no assistance here. \\n[106] Further, the evidence on the applicable American policies is of limited \\nassistance absent relevant factual findings. The record on this issue is mixe d. For \\ninstance, the respondents’ expert appeared to acknowledge that the one -year bar leads \\nto some individuals being denied asylum even if their underlying claims are meritorious \\n(Cross-examination of Stephen  Yale-Loehr, question  664, reproduced in A.R.,  \\n \\nthe one-year bar has exceptions for changed or extraordinary circumstances (see, e.g., \\nibid., questions  655 and  660-64; Affidavit of Anker, at para.  60; Affidavit of \\nJaya Ramji-Nogales, at para.  9, reproduced in A.R., vol.  XXX, at pp.  12752-53). \\nWithout findings of fact on how these exceptions function, this Court is not positioned \\nto assess whether the one -year bar actually leads to refoulement. Further, the various \\nalternative avenues for remaining in the United States, as described above, may be \\nrelevant. These exceptions and alternative avenues may be the manner in which the \\nUnited States implements its non-refoulement obligations in light of its one -year bar \\npolicy. \\n[107] The Federal Court judge’s lack of findings in relation to American policies \\non gender -based persecution also makes it imprudent for this Court to determine \\nwhether there is a real and not speculative risk of refoulement for claimants fleeing \\nsuch persecution. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for this Court to \\nattempt to make its own factual findings. In any event, as will become clear, even \\nassuming that these policies do present a real and not speculative risk of refoulement \\nfor returnees, I would not ultimately find a s. 7 breach on this basis.  \\n(d) Conclusion as to the Effects Implicating Section 7 Interests \\n[108] The risks of detention upon return to the United States, as well as three \\naspects of detention conditions as found by the Federal Court  judge — the use of \\nmedical isolation, abnormally cold conditions and deficiencies in medical care — fall \\n \\nappellants’ position on s. 7 engagement at its highest, I am prepared to proceed on the \\nassumption that the following effects occur and are within the scope of the s. 7 interests: \\nthe non -accommodation of religious dietary needs, detention in a facility housing \\ncriminally convicted individuals and the risks of refoulement flowing from the one -\\nyear bar policy and the United States’ approach to gender -based claims. With these \\neffects in mind, I turn to the causation analysis.  \\n(2) Causal Link to Canadian State Action \\n[109] As noted above, to establish s.  7 engagement, challengers must not only \\ndemonstrate effects falling within the scope of the s.  7 interests, but also that these \\neffects are caused by Canadian state action. In domestic matters, the requisite causal \\nlink will often be obvious. This is rarely so for cases where the deprivation in question \\nis effected by foreign actors. When connecting harms to Canadian state action, courts \\nmust be “sensitive to the context of the particular case” (Bedford, at para. 76). When a \\nchallenger seeks to draw a causal connection between Canadian state action and a harm \\nbrought about by a foreign actor, the context is meaningfully different from cases in \\nwhich harms arise through purely domestic processes.  \\n[110] Canada has no jurisdiction to dictate the actions of foreign authorities. \\nThus, to draw a causal connection to Canadian state action, Canadian authorities must \\nhave been implicated in how the harms arose. Accordingly, challengers will succeed in \\ndrawing a causal connection to Canadian state action “[a]t least where Canada’s \\n \\n[111] Further, Canada cannot foresee all the actions that foreign authorities will \\ntake. Where there is no basis for Canada to have known that a harm would arise, it \\nwould be improper to view those harms as causally connected to Canadian state action. \\nThus, to draw a causal connection to Canadian state action, it must be shown that \\nCanadian authorities knew, or ought to have known, that the harms could arise as a \\nresult of Canada’s actions. This has been expressed through the recognition that \\nchallengers will be able to show a causal connection to Canadian state action “[a]t least \\nwhere .  . . the deprivation is an entirely foreseeable consequence of Canada’s \\nparticipation” (Suresh, at para. 54 (emphasis added)). \\n(a) Necessary Precondition \\n[112] In this case, it is clear that Canada’s participation is a necessary \\nprecondition to each of the effects related to detention and refoulement. Without the \\nlegislative implementation of the Safe Third Country Agreement regime, individuals \\ncould advance their refugee protection claims in Canada. Instead, they are sent back to \\nthe United States by Canadian officials acting under legislative authority, where they \\nface (or are presumed to face) these effects. Thus, I have no he sitation in concluding \\nthat the relevant Canadian state action — here, s. 159.3 of the IRPR along with the \\nbroader legislative scheme — is a necessary precondition.  \\n \\n[113] In Bedford, this Court discussed the foreseeability threshold from  Suresh \\nand further explained its role (para. 77). Foreseeability, as described in Suresh, can be \\nestablished “by a reasonable inference, drawn on a balance of probabilities” (Bedford, \\nat para. 76). As is generally true, what is required is “a sufficient c onnection, having \\nregard to the context of the case” (para. 78). Nevertheless, foreseeability remains useful \\nin an international context where Canada does not necessarily have full knowledge of \\nhow foreign authorities will act (see, e.g., J.  C. Hathaway, The Rights of Refugees \\nUnder International Law (2nd ed. 2021), at pp. 367-68). To be plain, the foreseeability \\nstandard described in Suresh and interpreted in Bedford is binding on this Court. \\n[114] An effect can be shown to be foreseeable in at least two ways (s ee, e.g., \\nHathaway, at p. 373). First, challengers can show that Canada had actual knowledge of \\nthe risk that the effects would emerge. For example, Parliamentary debates discussing \\nthe risks may establish this knowledge. Second, challengers can also show that Canada \\nought to have known about the risks, such that knowledge can be imputed. Public \\nreporting, academic analysis, and other sources originating outside government may \\nhelp establish constructive knowledge. While speculation will not suffice, the threshold \\nfor constructive knowledge should remain attainable since foreseeability is a “port of \\nentry for s. 7 claims” (Bedford, at para. 78). For example, the threshold should remain \\nwell below the strict approach taken to judicial notice (see R. v. Find, 2001 SCC 32, \\n \\n[115] In this case, the Federal Court judge noted the Suresh causation framework \\nbut did not explicitly consider whether each of the relevant effects was foreseeable \\n(para. 100). She did not state what evidence co uld have allowed her to conclude that \\nCanada knew, or ought to have known, that these effects would occur. In my respectful \\nview, this approach led the Federal Court judge into reversible error in her application \\nof the foreseeability standard this Court established in Suresh and Bedford. \\n[116] With respect to the cold temperatures in detention facilities, deficiencies in \\nmedical care, detention alongside criminally convicted individuals and the violation of \\nreligious dietary restrictions, the record does not sup port a finding that these effects \\nwere a foreseeable consequence of Canada’s actions on the Suresh and Bedford \\nstandard. While these effects are concerning, the question at this stage is whether \\nCanada knew or ought to have known they could occur. The appellants have not pointed \\nto evidence that would enable this Court to answer this question in the affirmative in \\nlight of the absence of findings below. They have not established that Canada either \\nknew or ought to have known of this kind of harm arising in American detention \\nfacilities. Thus, in my respectful view, there was no basis for concluding that these \\neffects were a foreseeable consequence. \\n[117] By contrast, the record substantiates that the other negative effects were \\nentirely foreseeable. With respect to the risk of detention, it is plain that Canada knew \\nreturnees would be exposed to such a risk. From the earliest consultations on the scope \\n \\nthe subject of debate an d study (see, e.g., UNHCR, UNHCR Comments on the Draft \\nAgreement between Canada and the United States of America for “Cooperation in the \\nExamination of Refugee Status Claims from Nationals of Third Countries” , \\nJuly 26, 2002 (online), at p.  3). Similarly, t he “one -year bar” and the treatment of \\ngender-based claims were each focal points during the adoption of the agreement (see, \\ne.g., p.  2; Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement, SOR/2004 -217, Canada Gazette , \\nPart II, vol. 138, No. 22, November 3, 2004, at p. 1627). Further, Canada ought to have \\nknown that returnees were at risk of being subjected to the widespread practice of \\nmedical isolation. These infringements of liberty and security of the person are causally \\nconnected to Canadian state action and must be assessed in relation to the principles of \\nfundamental justice. \\nC. Principles of Fundamental Justice Analysis \\n(1) The Applicable Principles \\n[118] Here, the applicable principles of fundamental justice are overbreadth and \\ngross disproportionality. These principles were applied at first instance and are invoked \\nby the appellants before this Court. By contrast, the respondents argue that the “shocks \\nthe conscience” standard applies to “the constitutional review of the effects of removal \\nto foreign legal systems and administrations” (R.F., at para. 64). They submit that this \\nhigh threshold is only met in exceptional circumstances, as is proper given the \\nimportance of international comity and respect for the sovereignty of foreign states. In \\n \\nstandard may well be relevant to the review of individualized decisions, but it is not \\nrelevant to Charter challenges to legislation. \\n[119] It is true, as the respondents noted in oral argument, that “shocks the \\nconscience” was treated as applicable to legislative challenges by some members of \\nthis Court in Kindler v. Canada (Minister of Justice) , [1991] 2 S.C.R. 779, at \\npp. 849-50. But Kindler must be read in light of this Court’s later, more complete, \\nconsideration of “shocks the conscience” in Burns. It must also be read in the context \\nof this Court’s broader assessment of the principles of fundamental justice in Malmo-\\nLevine. \\n[120] In Burns, this Court made plain that the “shocks the conscience” standard \\napplies to reviewing individual decisions by the Minister and “should not be allowed \\nto obscure the ultimate assessment that is required”, which is whether those decisions \\nare “in accordance  with the principles of fundamental justice” (para.  68). Following \\nBurns, this Court has used “shocks the conscience” when assessing requests for \\nindividualized Charter relief from the Minister’s decisions on extradition or \\ndeportation rather than, as here, to evaluate the constitutionality of a legislative regime \\n(see, e.g., Lake v. Canada (Minister of Justice), 2008 SCC 23, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 761, at \\nparas. 38-39; Canada (Attorney General) v. Barnaby , 2015 SCC 31, [2015] 2 S.C.R. \\n563, at para.  11). Academic commentators have also concluded that the “shocks the \\nconscience” standard speaks to how “a discretionary decision by a state official can be \\n \\nmade is not itself challenged” ( see, e.g., Stewart (2019), at pp.  130-31). Indeed, in \\nMalmo-Levine, this Court explicitly concluded that a broad balancing exercise — of \\nthe kind that “shocks the conscience” describes — is not an applicable principle of \\nfundamental justice for challenges to legislation (paras. 94-99). It is true that in some \\ncontexts, the language of “shocks the conscience” has been used to inform the gross \\ndisproportionality standard (see, e.g., in relation to s.  12, R. v. Hills , 2023 SCC 2, at \\nparas. 109-10, 145 and 163, per Martin J., and at paras. 182-83, per Côté J., dissenting, \\nbut not on this point). As a practical matter, a provision held to be grossly \\ndisproportionate to its purpose might well shock the conscience if it were pressed into \\nservice. But this convergen ce does not displace the principles of fundamental justice \\nthat apply in challenges to legislation.  \\n[121] Because the appellants target legislative provisions, the “shocks the \\nconscience” standard is not the appropriate measure in this case. This is not to say,  \\nhowever, that whether governmental conduct shocks the conscience is not relevant to \\nchallenging the implementation of the Safe Third Country Agreement. Administrative \\ndecisions made under legislative schemes must, like the schemes themselves, respect \\nthe guarantees in the Charter. It therefore remains open to refugee claimants arriving \\nfrom the United States to advance constitutional challenges against determinations that \\ntheir claims are ineligible to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division or agai nst \\ndecisions that exceptional relief is unavailable. As this Court has recognized, it is \\n \\nthe same proceeding (see, e.g., PHS, at paras.  74-77; Kindler, at p.  840, per \\nMcLachlin J.).  \\n[122] If claimants in future cases challenge administrative conduct, courts may \\nconclude that returning them would shock the conscience of Canadians (see Burns, at \\npara. 69). In this way, vulnerable claimants whom Canada improperly seeks to return \\ncan be protected. However, at oral argument, the appellants expressly disclaimed any \\nintention to challenge the constitutionality of administrative decisions to deny them \\nexemptions. \\n[123] None of the foregoing implies that the respondents’ concern for \\ninternational comity and foreign states’ sovereignty is unwarranted. In my view, \\nhowever, these concerns can be accommodated under the principles of overbreadth and \\ngross disproportionality. To begin with, the Suresh and Bedford causation analysis \\nensures that Canadian courts only assess effects brought about by foreign actors if those \\neffects are causally connected to Canadian state action. \\n[124] Further, the Bedford principles of fundamental justice provide space to \\nconsider comity and foreign sovereignty. This is because arbitrariness, overbreadth and \\ngross disproportionality are principles of “instrumental rationality” or of means -ends \\nassessment, which can only be examined in light of the impugned law’s purpose \\n(paras. 107-9; Stewart (2019), at pp.  150-51; P.  W. Hogg, “The Brilliant Career of \\nSection 7 of the Charter” (2012), 58 S.C.L.R. (2d) 195, at p.  209). The proper \\n \\ninternational context, in which there will rarely, if ever, be e xact correspondence \\nbetween foreign and Canadian regimes. Courts should thus hesitate to conclude that \\nsuch legislation is predicated on the laws of the foreign state precisely mirroring those \\nof Canada. In these circumstances, I emphasize that courts must  take due care in \\ndefining the purpose of Canadian legislation. \\n[125] Finally, this Court has left open the possibility that a s.  7 breach might be \\njustified under s.  1 in appropriate circumstances ( Malmo-Levine, at paras.  96-98; \\nBedford, at para. 129). This Cou rt has also emphasized that the s. 1 analysis must be \\napproached with sensitivity to the factual and social context of each case (see, e.g., \\nRJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 199, at para. 63, \\nper La  Forest J., dissenting, bu t not on this point, and at paras.  132-34, per \\nMcLachlin J.). At the s.  1 stage, a contextual approach would likely consider \\ninternational comity and the sovereignty of foreign states.  \\n(2) The Scheme Is Not Overbroad or Grossly Disproportionate \\n[126] The respondents do not mention Bedford in their factum. Although their \\nposition is that the Bedford principles of fundamental justice do not apply to this appeal, \\ntheir failure to address Bedford was unhelpful. The appellants’ case focused on \\noverbreadth and gross disproportionality at each stage of the proceedings. The Federal \\nCourt applied these principles and the Court of Appeal commented on them. It would \\ntherefore have been useful to this Court for the respondents to provide explanations, or \\n \\n[127] Here, the Bedford principles apply. When assessing whether legislation \\nviolates these principles, courts consider “whether the law’s purpose, taken at face \\nvalue, is connected to its effects and whether the negative ef fect is grossly \\ndisproportionate to the law’s purpose” (para. 125). This requires courts to identify the \\nlegislative purpose and then to assess if, in light of that purpose, the legislation \\nbreached any applicable principle of fundamental justice. \\n(a) Legislative Purpose \\n[128] The courts below relied on the purpose of the legislative scheme articulated \\nin CCR (2008), at para. 75: “. . . the sharing of responsibility for the consideration of \\nrefugee claims with countries that are signatory to and comply with the relevant articles \\nof [the Refugee Convention  and the Convention Against Torture ] and have an \\nacceptable human rights record” (Federal Court reasons, at paras.  119-22; C.A. \\nreasons, at para.  164). The appellants advance a broader view of the place of \\ninternational law in the scheme’s purpose, saying that it is designed “to share \\nresponsibility for the protection of refugees in accordance with Canada’s international \\nobligations” (A.F., at para. 56 (emphasis deleted)). Conversely, the respondents would \\nhave this Court adopt a purpose that does not make international obligations explicit: \\n“. . . to share responsibility for providing protection to those in need and to improve the \\nefficiency of the refugee determination system” (R.F., at para.  26). I would n ot adopt \\n \\nresponsibility for fairly considering refugee claims with the United States, in \\naccordance with the principle of non-refoulement. \\n[129] In R. v. Ndhlovu, 2022 SCC 38, this Court reiterated several principles \\nguiding the characterization of legislative purpose within a s. 7 analysis. It noted, for \\ninstance, that the focus is the purpose of the impugned provisions, although the broader \\nlegislative scheme may provide clues as to the narrower provisions’ purpose (para. 61, \\nper Karakatsanis and Martin JJ., and para. 153, per Brown J., dissenting in part, but not \\non this point). Courts may consider “statements of purpose in the legislation, if any; the \\ntext, context, and scheme of the legislation; and extrinsic evidence” (para. 64; see also \\nR. v. Appulonappa, 2015 SCC 59, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 754, at para. 33).  \\n[130] Purpose statements are “[t]he first, ‘most direct and authoritative evidence’ \\nof the legislative purpose” (Appulonappa, at para. 49, citing R. Sullivan, Sullivan on \\nthe Construction of Statutes (6th ed. 2014), at pp.  274-76). Here, while the specific \\nsections containing the impugned provisions do not provide formal purpose statements, \\ns. 3(2) of the IRPA articulates the Act’s overall objectives with respect to refugees: \\n(2) The objectives of this Act with respect to refugees are \\n \\n(a) to recognize that the refugee program is in the first instance about \\nsaving lives and offering protection to the displaced and persecuted; \\n \\n(b) to fulfil Canada’s international legal obligations with respect to \\nrefugees and affirm Canada’s commitment to international efforts to \\nprovide assistance to those in need of resettlement; \\n \\n(c) to grant, as a fundamental expression of Canada’s humanitarian \\nideals, fair consideration to those who come to Canada claiming \\npersecution; \\n \\n(d) to offer safe haven to persons with a well -founded fear of \\npersecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or \\nmembership in a particular social group, as we ll as those at risk of \\ntorture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment; \\n \\n(e) to establish fair and efficient procedures that will maintain the \\nintegrity of the Canadian refugee protection system, while upholding \\nCanada’s respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all \\nhuman beings;  \\n[131] These objectives supply three key considerations relevant to assessing the \\npurpose of the provisions at issue here: respecting Canada’s international obligations \\n(s. 3(2)(b) and  (d)), ensuring fair process and consideration for claimants \\n(s. 3(2)(b), (c) and (e)), and upholding the efficiency and sustainability of the Canadian \\nrefugee protection system (s.  3(2)(e)). Further, s. 102(1) of the IRPA also speaks to \\nlegislative objective in this instance insofar as it permits the designation of countries \\n“for the purpose of sharing responsibility with governments of foreign states for the \\nconsideration of refugee claims”. \\n[132] With respect to the text and context of the legislative scheme, the provision \\ndirectly challenged is s. 159.3 of the IRPR. This provision designates the United States \\npursuant to s. 102(1)(a) of the IRPA. In my view, the purpose of a provision designating \\na specific country can only be understood in light of s. 102(2), as the Federal Court of \\nAppeal recognized in CCR (2008). Considering the factors set out in s.  102(2) is a \\ncondition precedent to designating a country. These factors, identified by Parliament, \\n \\ncountry’s “policies and practices with respect to claims under the Refugee Convention \\nand with respect to obligations under the Convention Against Torture” (s.  102(2)(b)). \\nThe “human rights record” of a country is another (s. 102(2)(c)).  \\n[133] The authority to designate a country flows from s. 102(1)(a), which focuses \\non whether the designated country complies with the non-refoulement principle, as \\nembodied in Article 33 of the Refugee Convention and Article 3 of the Convention \\nAgainst Torture. The non-refoulement principle, which scholars have also described as \\nthe [TRANSLATION] “cornerstone of refugee law” (see, e.g., F.  Crépeau, Droit d’asile: \\nDe l’hospitalité aux contrôles migratoires  (1995), at p.  166), is thus of central \\nimportance to the scheme’s purpose. Indeed, even scholars who are critical of the \\nagreement have recognized that it “evinces a joint commitment to ensuring access to a \\nrefugee protection procedure in either Canada or the United States” in order to respect \\nthe non-refoulement principle (Macklin (2005), at p.  381; Mayrand and \\nSmith-Grégoire, at p. 337). \\n[134] The various factors in s.  102(2) of the IRPA clearly relate to the non-\\nrefoulement principle. But they also go beyond it. By referencing policies and practices \\nrelated to the Refugee Convention  and the Convention Against Torture as a whole \\n(s. 102(2)(b)), the legislation directs the Governor in Council to consider a broad range \\nof guarantees designed to ensure that refugee claimants receiv e fair treatment in host \\ncountries. The requirement in s.  102(2)(c) to consider a country’s “human rights \\n \\ntreatment beyond the floor established by the non-refoulement principle. These \\nrequirements do not suggest that designated countries must have identical policies or \\nhuman rights records to Canada, so long as the designated countries respect certain \\nminimum requirements. In that sense, the s. 102(2) factors leave space for permissible \\ndifferences in countries’ domestic regimes, which reflects Parliament’s respect for \\ninternational comity, within the bounds of the Constitution.  \\n[135] The broader statutory scheme that structures the legal effects flowing from \\ndesignating a countr y is also illuminating, in that it shows that sharing responsibility \\nwith a designated country is a core objective. In particular, s.  101(1)(e) of the IRPA \\nrenders individuals arriving from designated countries ineligible to be referred to the \\nRefugee Protection Division. Access to other procedures in Canada is also restricted \\n(see, e.g., IRPA, s. 112(2)(b)). The message is clear: designation ensures that claims \\nwill be considered in the designated country, rather than in Canada. \\n[136] Finally, three sources of e xtrinsic evidence assist in ascertaining the \\npurpose of s.  159.3 of the IRPR. First, the preamble to the Safe Third Country \\nAgreement provides useful indicators of Parliament’s and the Governor in Council’s \\nobjectives in enacting the legislation that gives  domestic effect to the treaty. As \\ndiscussed, the preamble acknowledges the non-refoulement obligations that bind both \\ncountries (para. 2). It states that the governments were aware of the necessity to avoid \\n“indirect breaches of the fundamental principle of non -refoulement . . . [through] \\n \\npreamble to the Safe Third Country Agreement  confirms that the non-refoulement \\nprinciple is at the core of the scheme, along with a br oader emphasis on the fair \\nadjudication of refugee claims. It was in light of these mutually held commitments that \\nthe sharing of responsibility was proposed. \\n[137] Second, the accompanying Statement of Principles  agreed to by Canada \\nand the United States reflects a shared commitment to ensuring that refugee claimants \\nsubject to the scheme are treated fairly. For instance, it affords claimants an opportunity \\nfor a chosen person to be present during proceedings.  \\n[138] Third, the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement for s.  159.3 of the IRPR \\nstated that the “purpose of the provisions is to render paragraph 101(1)(e) of the [IRPA] \\neffective” by designating the United States in order to proceed with “sharing \\nresponsibility [for] refugee protection” while also respecting “Canada’s commitment \\nto its international obligations toward refugees”, which “reflects our humanitarian \\ntradition and core values of compassion and fairness” (pp. 1622-23).  \\n[139] Taken together, the statement of ob jectives of the IRPA, the text, context, \\nand scheme of the legislation, and the extrinsic evidence suggest that the purpose of \\nthe legislation has three essential elements: (1) to share responsibility for considering \\nrefugee claims; (2) to respect the non-refoulement principle; and (3) to return refugee \\nclaimants only to countries that will fairly consider their claims. Given these elements, \\nthe legislative purpose of s.  159.3 of the IRPR is to share responsibility for fairly \\n \\nnon-refoulement. This purpose reflects a primary goal (sharing responsibility), which \\nis subject to two limits (the non-refoulement principle and the requirement for fair \\nconsideration). Notably, thes e two limits do not disclose an expectation that the \\nAmerican asylum claim system mirror the Canadian system in every respect. It is in \\nlight of this purpose that the relevant s.  7 deprivations — the risk of discretionary \\ndetention and medical isolation, along with the presumed risks of refoulement — must \\nbe assessed for overbreadth and gross disproportionality.  \\n(b) Risks of Detention and Medical Isolation \\n[140] The appellants argue that the risks of detention and medical isolation are \\nboth overbroad and grossly disproportionate. I am not persuaded that either principle \\nof fundamental justice is breached in the circumstances of this case. \\n[141] With respect to overbreadth, the question is whether the impugned \\nlegislation “is so broad in scope that it includes some conduct that bears no relation to \\nits purpose” (Bedford, at para. 112 (emphasis deleted)). As this Court has affirmed, a \\nlaw is overbroad if it overreaches in a single case (paras.  113 and 123; Ndhlovu, at \\npara. 78). This analysis is focused not on “whether Par liament has chosen the least \\nrestrictive means, but whether the chosen means infringe life, liberty or security of the \\nperson in a way that has no connection with the mischief contemplated by the \\n \\n[142] In my view, the risk of  detention in the United States, with opportunities \\nfor release and review, is related to the legislative objective. Sharing responsibility for \\nrefugee claims with another state will necessarily expose returnees to the foreign legal \\nregime that governs ref ugee claimants’ presence in that country. Exposure to foreign \\nlegal systems — including their detention practices — necessarily results from \\nachieving the scheme’s purpose. Of course, the legislation’s responsibility -sharing \\nobjective is qualified by the r equirement that refugee claimants are to be given fair \\nconsideration in the designated country. But whether this requirement is respected does \\nnot turn on the extent to which the American asylum system mirrors Canada’s system. \\nA degree of difference as bet ween the legal schemes applicable in the two countries \\ncan be tolerated, so long as the American system is not fundamentally unfair. Thus, for \\nthe appellants to show that the scheme overreaches this limit — such that there is “no \\nconnection” at all between the effects of the scheme and the legislative objective, which \\nincludes the aim of only returning refugee claimants to countries that will fairly \\nconsider their claims (see Carter, at para. 85) — the question is whether the American \\nsystem is fundamentally unfair. In my view, the record does not support the conclusion \\nthat the American detention regime is fundamentally unfair. \\n[143] International legal instruments provide indicia of what it means to treat \\nrefugee claimants fairly. For instance, the UNHCR’s Detention Guidelines recognize \\nthat detention of refugee claimants “is neither prohibited under international law per \\nse, nor is the right to liberty of person absolute” (Guidelines on the Applicable Criteria \\n \\nDetention (2012), Guideline  4, at para.  18). The Detention Guidelines require \\nsafeguards in relation to the use of detention. The particular form of these safeguards \\nis a matter of state practice. Here, the appellants did not discharge their burden to show \\nthat safeguards are absent in the American asylum system. While the record shows that \\nreturnees face a risk of detention in the United States, it also discloses mechanisms that \\ncreate opportunities for release and provide for rev iew by administrative decision \\nmakers and courts. There is no basis to infer that these arrangements are fundamentally \\nunfair. Thus, the risk of detention that returnees face is not overbroad. \\n[144] Similarly, the use of medical isolation is not fundamentally unfair. Nothing \\nin the record suggests that isolating those awaiting tuberculosis test results is \\nunnecessary to control public health risks in detention facilities. Indeed, the United \\nNations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela \\nRules), U.N. Doc. A/RES/70/175, December  17, 2015, require that where individuals \\nin detention facilities are suspected of having contagious diseases, measures are taken \\n“providing for the clinical isolation and adequate treatment of those prisone rs during \\nthe infectious period” (Rule 30(d)). Of course, the Mandela Rules also restrict the use \\nof isolation or segregation (see, e.g., Rules 37(d), 43(1), 44 and 45). But the appellants \\ndo not point to evidence that would sustain an inference that medical isolation is being \\nused improperly in the American immigration detention system. \\n[145] It is true that the record includes the affidavits of two lawyers from \\n \\nbroadly. For instance, the lawyers suggested solitary confinement may be used to deal \\nwith claimants facing mental health challenges (Affidavit of Ruby  Robinson, at \\npara. 18, reproduced in A.R., vol. XXXIII, at pp. 13884-85) or as a punitive mechanism \\n(Affidavit of Timo thy Warden-Hertz at para.  8, reproduced in A.R., vol.  XXXIII, at \\npp. 13807-8). However, there are no findings below on these specific matters. The \\nFederal Court judge did not find that the American immigration detention system \\nimposes isolation on individuals with mental health challenges or that isolation is used \\npunitively. \\n[146] This Court is appropriately reluctant to assume the mantle of a finder of \\nfact (Hollis v. Dow Corning Corp. , [1995] 4 S.C.R. 634, at para.  33, per La Forest J., \\nand at para.  89, per Sopinka J., dissenting, but not on this point). Here, given the \\nlimitations of the evidentiary record, it would be imprudent for this Court to make \\nfactual determinations about how the United States uses solitary confinement in \\nimmigration detention. There is therefore no basis to conclude that American practices \\nare fundamentally unfair. As a result, I am not satisfied that the risk of medical isolation \\nfor individuals returned to the United States is an overbroad effect of the Canadian \\nlegislation. \\n[147] With res pect to gross disproportionality, the question is whether the \\nimpugned legislation’s effects on the s.  7 interests are “so grossly disproportionate to \\nits purposes that they cannot rationally be supported” ( Bedford, at para.  120). This \\n \\ntotally out of sync with the objective” and is “entirely outside the norms accepted in \\nour free and democratic society” (ibid.). Neither a risk of detention with opportunities \\nfor release and review nor a risk of medical isolation meets this high threshold. In \\nCanada, as in the United States, these risks are within the mutually held norms accepted \\nby our free and democratic societies. The appellants have not shown otherwise. \\n(c) Risks of Refoulement Due to American Asylum Policies \\n[148] Subjecting returnees to real and not speculative risks of refoulement would \\nbear no relation to the purpose of the impugned legislation, which has respect for the \\nnon-refoulement principle at its core. A provision mandatin g return to a risk of \\nrefoulement would therefore be overbroad. Similarly, a provision mandating return to \\na risk of refoulement would be grossly disproportionate because doing so would, by \\ndefinition, expose individuals to risks to their life or freedom ( Refugee Convention, \\nArticle 33), torture ( Convention Against Torture , Article 3) or other fundamental \\nhuman rights violations. Scholars have criticized these sorts of mandatory regimes, \\nwhich require countries to assume “the partner state’s ability and willingness to protect \\nrefugees” (see, e.g., Hathaway, at p.  330). However, the impugned legislation in this \\ncase does not simply mandate return: there are also related curative provisions that must \\nbe factored into the analysis. These provisions include admi nistrative deferrals of \\nremoval ( IRPA, s.  48(2)), temporary resident permits (s.  24), humanitarian and \\ncompassionate exemptions (s. 25.1(1)) and public policy exemptions (s. 25.2(1)). I note \\n \\nmeasures, she properly recognized — in her s.  7 analysis under the headings of \\n“Overbroad” and “Grossly Disproportionate” in her reasons — that safety valves are \\ngermane to the assessment of the Bedford principles of fundamental justice.  \\n[149] As this Court held in PHS, when the impugned legislative scheme contains \\nsafety valves, the question is whether these mechanisms — properly interpreted and \\napplied — are sufficient to ensure that no deprivations contrary to the principles of \\nfundamental justice occur (para. 113; see also Moore, at pp. 150-51). Plainly, if no such \\ndeprivations materialize, then there is no breach of s. 7. This observation is what, in my \\nview, explains McLachlin C.J.’s statement in PHS that “if one were to set out to dr aft \\na law that combats drug abuse while respecting Charter rights, one might well adopt \\n. . . a prohibition combined with the power to grant exemptions” (para. 114). \\n[150] The IRPA’s curative provisions are, in many key respects, analogous to the \\nsafety valve in the CDSA upon which the Court relied in PHS. For example, s. 25.1 of \\nthe IRPA is structurally similar to what was then s. 56 of the CDSA. Both mechanisms \\ncontemplate the exercise of ministerial discretion to grant relief from rules that would \\notherwise apply. Moreover, they both grant a broad discretionary authority, as they \\npermit exemptions from any of the Act’s provisions (in the case o f the CDSA) or any \\nof the Act’s applicable criteria or obligations (in the case of the IRPA). Exemptions on \\npublic policy grounds ( IRPA, s. 25.2) play a comparable role. Further, administrative \\ndeferrals of removal (s.  48(2)) and temporary resident permits  (s. 24) also create \\n \\n[151] When the IRPA’s safety valves are activated, claimants can be exempted \\nfrom return. If they are not returned to the United States, they do not f ace any risk of \\nrefoulement from the United States. The safety valves can therefore intervene to cure \\nwhat might otherwise be unconstitutional effects, as was the case in PHS. Moreover, \\nas in PHS, they are properly considered as part of the principles of fundamental justice \\nstage of s. 7 because the mechanisms can be exercised in order to address the specific \\ndeprivation at issue, in this case the risk of refoulement.  \\n[152] The appellants argue that “overbroad and grossly disproportionate effects \\ncannot be cured ” by these mechanisms in the IRPA (A.F., at para. 67). They say the \\nsafety valves are irrelevant because they are “not among the legislative and regulatory \\nprovisions implementing the [Safe Third Country Agreement] ineligibility” (para. 69). \\nI disagree. This is not a case where the scheme’s safety valves are so disconnected from \\nthe deprivation that they are irrelevant for determining whether the challenged \\nprovision violates s. 7 of the Charter. Properly interpreted, the curative mechanisms in \\nthe broader statutory scheme are sufficient to ensure that individuals are not subjected \\nto real and not speculative risks of refoulement, if such risks do exist. These \\nmechanisms must be understood in light of the discretion that Article 6 of the Safe \\nThird Country A greement preserves for Canada to consider claims when it is in its \\npublic interest to do so.  \\n[153] In Article 6, the parties agreed that each of them could examine “ any \\n \\nhas i mplemented this provision in a manner that leaves room for discretion and \\nconsideration of various humanitarian factors (see, e.g., UNHCR, Monitoring Report: \\nCanada-United States “Safe Third Country” Agreement (2006), at pp. 63-65). Nothing \\nin the agreemen t prevented Canada from leaving in place mechanisms that permit a \\nsimilar approach.  \\n[154] The mere fact that these mechanisms predate the treaty does not make them \\nirrelevant. Indeed, scholars have observed that “[t]he great majority of treaties \\nconcluded by Canada are in the nature of state -to-state agreements that do not require \\namendment of the internal laws of either party” (van Ert, at p.  233). When the \\nagreement was signed, Canadian domestic law already included provisions that could \\nfacilitate individuali zed consideration of claimants’ circumstances when it is in \\nCanada’s public interest to do so. New legislation implementing additional \\nmechanisms was not necessary. Likewise, it is of no consequence that these provisions \\nare found in other, generally appli cable parts of the IRPA. As I have said, Charter \\nanalyses must consider all relevant provisions in an interrelated legislative scheme. \\n[155] The related provisions in the IRPA and IRPR provide various avenues for \\nrefugee claimants to be exempted from return on a  temporary or permanent basis. For \\ninstance, an officer who is persuaded during an initial interview that a real and not \\nspeculative risk of refoulement exists could refer the case to Immigration, Refugees \\nand Citizenship Canada for further consideration. That department could then \\n \\ncompassionate exemption under s. 25.1 of the IRPA, including waiving the s. 101(1)(e) \\nineligibility. Alternatively, the Minister might decide that grounds for granting a \\ntemporary resident permit exist, thus providing time for determining whether \\npermanent resident status should be granted on humanitarian and compassionate \\ngrounds. These avenues are, of course, not exhaustive. But they suggest that the \\nstatutory scheme can limit the risk of harm that the general rule might otherwise \\noccasion. \\n[156] It is true that Canada has only ever expressly relied on Article 6 to create \\ncategorical exceptions (Canada, A Partnership for Protection: Year One Review  \\n(2006), at p. 37). Nevertheless, Canada has long been aware that Article 6 may permit \\nit to consider the claims of “individuals who would not normally be eligible under an \\nexception but who nevertheless warrant special consideration because of their \\nvulnerability” (UNHC R, Monitoring Report , at p.  36; see also A Partnership for \\nProtection, at pp.  35-37). I share this reading of Article 6, which must inform the \\ninterpretation of the existing exemption mechanisms.  \\n[157] The appellants argue in their factum that the Federal Court  judge found \\nthese mechanisms to be “illusory” and “largely out of reach” (A.F., at para.  68). The \\nrespondents, by contrast, say these mechanisms “exist in law” and the Court of Appeal \\nfound that they were available in practice, as the record reflects (R.F ., at para. 91). In \\n \\n[158] It is clear that an exemption would be merely “illusory” — and thus \\nincapable of curing constitutional defects — if there were no possibility of accessing it \\nin law. For example, if there is no legal pathway to obtain a statutory exemption, then \\nit is illusory (see Parker, at para. 174). It is also insufficient for curative mechanisms \\nto be available in law but unavailable in practice. Empty promises do not safeguard \\nagainst breaches of  constitutionally protected rights. For instance, this Court has \\nrecognized that a statute permitting exemptions may nonetheless create barriers to \\naccessing them (see, e.g., R. v. Morgentaler , [1988] 1 S.C.R. 30, at pp. 60 -62, per \\nDickson C.J., and at pp.  91-100, per Beetz J.). It is open to challengers to argue that \\nlegislation unjustifiably breaches s. 7 because the exemption mechanism itself \\nproduces difficulties for individuals seeking access to it (Morgentaler, at pp. 73-76, per \\nDickson C.J., and at p p. 122-28, per Beetz J.). This Court has, however, emphasized \\nthat the legislation must be the cause of the alleged difficulties in order for Charter \\nscrutiny to attach to it (see Little Sisters, at para. 128).  \\n[159] It may not always be obvious whether the sou rce of an alleged breach is \\nthe legislation or the administrative conduct implementing it (see, e.g., A. M. Latimer \\nand B. L. Berger, “A Plumber with Words: Seeking Constitutional Responsibility and \\nan End to the Little Sisters Problem” (2022), 104 S.C.L.R. (2d) 143, at pp. 145-46). In \\napplying Morgentaler and Little Sisters , it is appropriate to look to the broader \\njurisprudence on the assessment of causation in s. 7 challenges. As is true at every stage \\nof proving a s. 7 violation, challengers bear the evidentiary burden to establish that the \\n \\n(Bedford, at para.  78). They must therefore show that the legislation causes the \\nexemption to be illusory in their individual circumstances. Challengers need not show \\nthat the legislation causes exemptions to be illusory in general, as the s.  7 analysis is \\nnot focused on “the percentage of the population that is negatively impacted” \\n(para. 123). When courts conclude that the le gislation causes the alleged difficulties, \\nthey should explain how this burden is met for each of the relevant curative \\nmechanisms.  \\n[160] It is true that the Federal Court judge wrote that “safeguards . . . are largely \\nout of reach and are therefore ‘illusory’”  (para. 130). Nevertheless, as the appellants \\nthemselves acknowledged in oral argument before this Court, when that statement is \\nread in context, the Federal Court judge’s immediate focus was on the practical \\navailability of judicial review proceedings. As  discussed above, the availability of \\njudicial review is distinct from whether there are statutory safeguards that may function \\nas curative mechanisms or “safety valves”. The Federal Court judge’s reasons in this \\ncase do not point to a considered finding that all the relevant curative mechanisms are \\nillusory for any individual. Indeed, she did not assess the relevant curative mechanisms \\nin any substantive way. In my respectful view, this was an error of law reflecting a \\nfailure to consider how the relevant legislative provisions might apply to the question \\nat hand — although the Federal Court judge can hardly be blamed for it, as the parties’ \\narguments before her do not appear to have squarely addressed how these mechanisms \\n \\n[161] Had the full range of relevant curative measures been considered, the \\nFederal Court judge would have recognized that there is insufficient evidence in the \\nrecord regarding their practical operation. For example, the appellants have identified \\nno evidence that could support a finding that an individual returnee would not have \\naccess to these mechanisms. Instead, the record shows that administrative deferrals of \\nremoval, temporary resident permits, and humanitarian and compassionate \\nconsideration are available. I note, in particular, the circumstances of Ms. Al Nahass’s \\nfamily, who did receive temporary resident permits and permanent residence on \\nhumanitarian and compassionate grounds. Thus, the record in this case cannot sustain \\nthe conclusion that the applicable curative mechanisms are “illusory”. In any event, the \\nFederal Court judge’s error of law means that her comment does not bind this Court. \\n[162] The public interest authority preserved in Article 6 may be exercised on an \\nindividualized basis through the IRPA’s curative mechanisms. Absent a finding that \\nthese mechanisms are illusory or otherwise inadequate to respond to the potential \\nharms, realizing the Article 6 discretion in this manner poses no constitutional defect. \\nIt is, of course, also open to the Governor in Council to make regulations respecting \\nthe criteria for the application of s.  101(1)(e) ineligibility in order to clarify when the \\ngeneral principle of return should not apply ( IRPA, s.  102(1)(c)). The Governor in \\nCouncil has done so in s. 159.6 of the IRPR, which exempts individuals subject to the \\ndeath penalty from return. This exception responds to a marked difference between \\nAmerican and Canadian law. It is thus one example of how sharing responsibility need \\n \\nacceptance that each party to the treaty will abide by its own distinctive view of when \\nconsidering a refugee claim is in its public interest. Further, regulations under \\ns. 102(1)(c) are not the o nly avenue for specifying circumstances that warrant an \\nArticle 6 exception. The Minister may also set out classes for whom public policy \\ndictates that an exception should be established ( IRPA, s. 25.2). Using the authority \\nunder s. 102(1)(c) or 25.2 to clarify the relevant exceptional circumstances may make \\nthe process more efficient and predictable. \\n[163] In sum, even assuming that claimants face real and not speculative risks of \\nrefoulement from the United States, the Canadian legislative scheme provides safet y \\nvalves that guard against such risks. For that reason, the legislative scheme \\nimplementing the Safe Third Country Agreement  is not overbroad or grossly \\ndisproportionate and therefore accords with the principles of fundamental justice. In \\nlight of this conclusion, as well as my conclusions on deprivations related to detention, \\nno breach of s. 7 of the Charter has been established.  \\n[164] I recall that the challenge here was advanced against legislation, not \\nadministrative conduct. It may be that administrative a ctors, such as CBSA officers, \\nacted unreasonably or unconstitutionally in their treatment of some returnees or in their \\ninterpretation of the legislative scheme, including its safety valves. As noted above, \\nwhen administrative action or inaction is the cau se of the alleged harms, then that \\nconduct is properly the subject of Charter scrutiny, not the legislation itself. But these \\n \\nreturning individuals to circumstances that w ould shock the conscience of Canadians, \\nsuch as returning individuals to face a real and not speculative risk of refoulement, \\nconstitutional and administrative remedies remain available. Without saying more, I \\nobserve that administrative decisions in this area call for “the most anxious scrutiny” \\n(R. (Yogathas) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, [2002] UKHL 36, [2003] \\n1 A.C. 920, at paras.  9, 58 and  74, quoting R. v. Secretary of State for the Home \\nDepartment, Ex p. Bugdaycay, [1987] A.C. 514 (H.L.), at p. 531). \\nD. Section 1 \\n[165] Given that the legislative scheme does not violate s.  7, it is not necessary \\nto undertake a s.  1 analysis. However, for the sake of completeness, I provide some \\nbrief comments on s. 1 justification for circumstances in which it would be required. \\nIn doing so, I highlight the distinct relevance of safety valves in a s.  1 analysis where \\nthe burden of justification is on the state. \\n[166] The appellants argue that while legislative safety valves did not ensure that \\nthe legislation accords with the principles of fundamental justice under s.  7, such \\navenues for discretionary relief may remain relevant in addressing s. 1. However, they \\nsubmit that the respondents did not file any evidence in support of a s.  1 justification, \\nand they rely on the Federal Court judge’s statement that safeguards are “illusory”.  \\n[167] The respondents argue that had a s.  7 breach been made out, it would be \\n \\nsay that the whole of the  law serves to advance the pressing and substantial objective \\nof sharing responsibility for refugee status determinations with the United States. \\nFurther, they submit that the scheme is minimally impairing of claimants’ s.  7 rights \\nand point to the continuous monitoring of the regime under s.  102(3) of the IRPA and \\nto the IRPA’s safety valves. \\n[168] Both parties rightly acknowledge that safety valves are relevant at the s. 1 \\nstage, as this Court accepted in Carter (paras. 114-21). However, the role these \\nmechanisms play at the s.  1 stage differs from their role at the s.  7 stage as does, of \\ncourse, the burden that the state bears. This is because s.  7 and s.  1 “ask different \\nquestions” insofar as “justification on the basis of an overarching public goal is at the \\nheart of s.  1, but it plays no part in the s.  7 analysis, which is concerned with the \\nnarrower question of whether the impugned law infringes individual rights” ( Bedford, \\nat para. 125). Given this distinction, “a different set of considerations comes into play \\nunder section  1: not just the effect of the law on (at least) one person’s section  7 \\ninterests, but the effect of the section  7 violation in achieving the law’s policy \\nobjectives” (H. Stewart, “Bedford and the Structure of Section 7” (2015), 60 McGill \\nL.J. 575, at p. 589). When safety valves are at issue, the considerations in play under \\ns. 7 and s. 1 remain distinct.  \\n[169] While discretionary exemption mechanisms are relevant to determining \\nwhether impugned legislation breaches individual rights protected by s. 7, they may \\n \\njustice occur. In other words, they may not succeed in curing all deprivations of \\nindividuals’ s. 7 interests. For instance, the scope of a safety va lve may simply not be \\nwide enough to exempt all individuals inappropriately caught by the general rule.  \\n[170] As is the case throughout the s.  7 analysis, claimants bear the burden to \\nshow that legislative safety valves do not remedy individual deprivations. To  do so, \\nthey may, for example, advance arguments and lead evidence demonstrating that a \\nlegislative regime itself causes a statute’s curative mechanisms to be practically \\nunavailable. However, at the s. 1 stage, the government bears the burden to show that  \\nthe safety valves — as a whole — are sufficient to justify any established s. 7 breaches \\nunder the test from R. v. Oakes , [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103. This Court has left open the \\n“possibility that the government could establish that a s.  7 violation is justified ” \\n(Bedford, at para. 129). \\n[171] At the s. 1 stage, the government may argue — as Canada did here — that \\na scheme’s safety valves, if they proved to be imperfect under s. 7, nonetheless render \\nthe legislation minimally impairing. Further, the government might se ek to rely on \\nsafety valves in the final balancing stage of Oakes. Nonetheless, given that a s.  7 \\nviolation was not established in this case, it is unnecessary to comment on what the \\noutcome of any part of the s. 1 analysis might have been here.  \\nVIII. The Section 15 Claim  \\n \\n[172] In their factum, the appellants asked this Court to remit the matter to the \\nFederal Court. They acknowledge that, in declining to decide their claim under s. 15 of \\nthe Charter, the Federal Court judge made no findings of fact on which a gender-based \\ndiscrimination argument might rest. In oral argument, counsel for the appellants \\nadvanced the alternative argument that it is open to this Court to make the necessary \\nfactual findings to decide the s. 15 issue and noted that the matter was pleaded before \\nthe courts below. \\n[173] The basis of the appellants’ s.  15 claim in the Federal Court was that \\nwomen fearing gender -based persecution are adversely affected by s.  159.3 of the \\nIRPR. The appellants submitted, for instance, that the American interpretation of \\n“particular social group” — one of the classes of individuals protected from  \\nrefoulement under Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention — is overly restrictive with \\nrespect to women.  \\n[174] The respondents argue that there is no need to remit the matter because the \\nappellants’ gender-based concerns are properly addressed within the s.  7 analysis. In \\nthe respondents’ submission, what primarily drove the s.  15 claim was the decision in \\nMatter of A -B-, 27 I . & N. Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018), which was vacated in 2021. They \\nsubmit that the American system recognizes gender-related harms as a basis for asylum \\nclaims and that, on a fair reading of the record, there is no evidence of a s. 15 breach.  \\n \\n[175] The Supreme Court Act , R.S.C. 1985, c.  S-26, empowers this Court to \\nremand any appeal or part thereof to the court appealed from or the court of original \\njurisdiction (s. 46.1). This discretion is to be exerci sed “in the interests of justice” \\n(Wells v. Newfoundland, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 199, at para. 68; Saadati v. Moorhead, 2017 \\nSCC 28, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 543, at para. 45; R. v. Esseghaier, 2021 SCC 9, at para. 63). \\nHere, remitting the s. 15 challenge is just in the circumstances. \\n[176] A court of first instance would have, as a part of its fact -finding mandate, \\nan institutional advantage in making the determinations necessary to a fair treatment of \\nthe s. 15 claim. The evidentiary record is voluminous, and while this Court is entitled \\nto make factual findings based upon it, much of the expert affidavit evidence regarding \\nthe s.  15 allegations conflicts. For example, the Court would have to evaluate \\ncompeting expert opinions on a line of cases dealing with the American approa ch to \\ndefining a “particular social group” (see, e.g., Affidavit of Yale -Loehr, at \\nparas. 118-30; Affidavit of Karen  Musalo, at paras.  10 et seq., reproduced in A.R., \\nvol. XXI, at pp.  8965 et seq.). To decide the gender -based claim on the merits, this \\nCourt would have to assume the mantle of trier of fact and consider potentially \\nconflicting trends in American jurisprudence as an appellate court of final resort.  \\n[177] Appellate courts may — and occasionally are required to — assume the \\nrole of finder of fact whe re doing so is “in the interests of justice and feasible on a \\npractical level” (Hollis, at para. 33, per La Forest J.). However, they are “generally, and \\n \\nhave in drawing factual inferences. These include their “relative expertise with respect \\nto the weighing and assessing of evidence” and their “inimitable familiarity with the \\noften vast quantities of evidence” ( Housen, at para.  25). Appellate courts should be \\nespecially cautious, for example, when a first instance judge has failed to make \\nessential factual findings and where evidence conflicts or is in dispute ( Hollis, at \\nparas. 89 and 93, per Sopinka J., dissenting, but not on this point).  \\n[178] In my view, this Court is not  well placed to make the factual findings \\nnecessary to assess the merits of the s. 15 claim. Given the profound seriousness of the \\nmatter, the size and complexity of the record and the conflicting affidavit evidence, it \\nwould be neither “in the interests of justice” nor “feasible on a practical level” for this \\nCourt to take up the task of finder of fact (Hollis, at para. 33). Notably, there would be \\nno possibility of appeal with respect to any factual determinations this Court might \\nmake on the disputed, conflicting evidence. \\n[179] Further, it would not be in the interests of justice to dismiss the s. 15 claim \\nfor lack of argument. It is true that the appellants did not argue the substance of their \\ns. 15 claim before this Court beyond a brief mention in their factum and a reference in \\noral argument to their pleadings before the courts below. This Court has sometimes \\nheld that the aspects of a claim not argued by an appellant can be considered abandoned \\nand can thus be dismissed (see, e.g., Meyer v. General Exchange  Insurance Corp. , \\n[1962] S.C.R. 193, at p.  201, per Locke J.). These decisions rightly recognize that \\n \\nbefore this Court. Yet, I sense it would be inappropriate to interpret the appellants’ lack \\nof argument as an abandonment of serious submissions that the courts below \\ncommented on so briefly and did not decide. In the specific circumstances of this \\nappeal, it was not unreasonable for the appellants to limit their pleadi ngs to a request \\nfor this Court to remit the s.  15 matter. The alternate argument that the matter be \\ndecided here was not a considered position. It would have been unrealistic for the \\nappellants to attempt to fill the factual void left by the courts below while \\nsimultaneously advancing novel legal arguments, such as those relating to causation \\nand equality rights in the international context.  \\n[180] Finally, I note that certain interveners are troubled by what they see as a \\njudicial “pattern of neglect with respect to section 15” in challenges based on multiple \\nCharter rights (I.F., David Asper Centre for Constitutional Rights, West Coast Legal \\nEducation and Action Fund Association and Women’s Legal Education and Action \\nFund Inc., at para. 13). One can well understand the concern: claims based on s. 15 are \\nnot secondary issues only to be reached after all other issues are considered. The \\nCharter should not be treated as if it establishes a hierarchy of rights in which s.  15 \\noccupies a lower tier.  \\n[181] I would not fault  the Federal Court judge here for exercising judicial \\nrestraint and not deciding the s. 15 claim. I recognize that the principle of judicial policy \\nunderlying such restraint is sound, as “[i]t is based on the realization that unnecessary \\n \\nhave not been foreseen” ( Phillips v. Nova Scotia (Commission of Inquiry into the \\nWestray Mine Tragedy), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 97, at para. 9, per Sopinka J.). Even so, these \\njudicial policy consid erations are not always determinative. They must be weighed \\nagainst other factors, such as the possibility of an appeal and fairness to the parties. \\nWhile the proceeding at first instance remains the “main event” ( Housen, at para. 13, \\nquoting Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564 (1985), at pp. 574-75), the possibility \\nthat further proceedings might require addressing alternative constitutional grounds \\nshould be considered. As in this case, when first instance judges decline to consider \\nfurther constitutional issues, a false economy may arise if appellate courts have to remit \\nclaims. \\n[182] In sum, it is in the interests of justice to send the matter back to the Federal \\nCourt for determination, as the Federal Court of Appeal rightly recognized (para. 173). \\nNothing in these reasons should be taken to decide the factual or legal questions that \\nwill be relevant to the s. 15 challenge.  \\nIX. Conclusion \\n[183] I would answer the questions posed on appeal as follows. First, s. 159.3 of \\nthe IRPR is not ultra vires. Second, s. 159.3 does not breach s. 7 of the Charter. Third, \\nthe challenge based on s. 15 of the Charter should be remitted to the Federal Court.  \\n[184] Because the Federal Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and dismissed the \\n \\nbe set aside. In particular, the Court of Appeal erred in deciding that the challenge to \\ns. 159.3 of the IRPR based on s.  15 of the Charter should be dismissed rather than \\nremitted to the Federal Court. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal in part. Neither \\nparty sought costs. Like the courts below, I would make no order as to costs on the \\nappeal or the application for leave to appeal. \\n Appeal allowed in part. \\n Solicitor for the appellant s the Canadian Council for Refugees, Amnesty \\nInternational and the Canadian Council of Churches: Refugee Law Office, Toronto. \\n Solicitor for the appellants ABC, DE by her litigation guardian ABC, FG \\nby her litigation guardian ABC, and Nedira Jemal Mustefa: Downtown Legal Services, \\nToronto. \\n Solicitors for the appellants Mohammad Majd Maher Homsi, Hala Maher \\nHomsi, Karam Maher Homsi and Reda Yassin Al Nahass : Jared Will & Associates, \\nToronto. \\n Solicitors for the respondents: Department of Justice — Ontario Regional \\nOffice, Toronto; Department of Justice — Quebec Regional Office, Montréal. \\n Solicitors for the intervener Association québécoise des avocats et \\n \\n Solicitors for the intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association: \\nLandings, Toronto; Legal Aid Ontario — Refugee Law Office, Toronto; University of \\nBritish Columbia Allard School of Law, Vancouver. \\n Solicitors for the intervener the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers: \\nSilcoff Shacter, Toronto. \\n Solicitors for the intervener s the National Council of Canadian Muslims \\nand the Canadian Muslim Lawyers Association : Mithoowani Waldman Immigration \\nLaw, Toronto; National Council of Canadian Muslims, Ottawa. \\n Solicitors for the intervener s the Canadian Lawyers for International \\nHuman Rights and the Canadian Centre for Victims of Torture: Waldman & \\nAssociates, Toronto. \\n Solicitor for the intervener the Queen’s Prison Law Clinic: Alison M. \\nLatimer, K.C., Vancouver. \\n Solicitors for the interve ner the Rainbow Refugee Society: Pender \\nLitigation, Vancouver; Vayeghan Litigation, Vancouver. \\n Solicitors for the intervener the British Columbia Civil Liberties \\n \\n Solicitors for the intervener the Advocates for the Rule of Law: McCarthy \\nTétrault, Vancouver; Jordan Honickman, Toronto. \\n Solicitors for the intervener s the David Asper Centre for Constitutional \\nRights, the West Coast Legal Education and Action Fund Association and the Women’s \\nLegal Education and Action Fund Inc.: University of Toronto, Faculty of Law, Toronto; \\nJamie Liew, Ottawa. \\n Solicitors for the intervener the HIV & AIDS Legal Clinic Ontario: Henein \\nHutchison, Toronto. \\n Solicitors for the intervener the Rainbow Railroad: Battista Smith \\n'}]"

Russian Federation) \\n \\nRequest for the indication of provisional measures \\nI. INTRODUCTION (PARAS. 1-16) \\n The Court recalls that, on 16  January 2017, Ukraine instituted proceedings against the \\nRussian Federation with regard to alleged violations of the International Convention f or the \\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism (ICSFT) and the International Convention on the \\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). On the same day, Ukraine submitted a \\nrequest for the indication of provisional measures, aimed at sa feguarding the rights it claims under \\nthose two conventions pending the Court’s decision on the merits. With respect to the ICSFT, in paragraph  23 of its Request for the indication of provisional \\nmeasures, Ukraine asked the Court to indicate the following provisional measures: \\n“(a) The Russian Federation shall refrain from any action which might aggravate or \\nextend the dispute under the Terrorism Financing Convention before the Court or \\nmake this dispute more difficult to resolve. (b) The Russian Federatio n shall exercise appropriate control over its border to \\nprevent further acts of terrorism financing, including the supply of weapons from \\nthe territory of the Russian Federation to the territory of Ukraine. (c) The Russian Federation shall halt and prevent all transfers from the territory of the \\nRussian Federation of money, weapons, vehicles, equipment, training, or \\npersonnel to groups that have engaged in acts of terrorism against civilians in \\nUkraine, or that the Russian Federation knows may in the future  engage in acts of \\nterrorism against civilians in Ukraine, including but not limited to the ‘Donetsk \\nPeople’s Republic’, the ‘Luhansk People’s Republic’, the ‘Kharkiv Partisans’, and \\nassociated groups and individuals.

(e) The Russian Federation shall cease and desist from acts of political and cultural \\nsuppression against the ethnic Ukrainian people in Crimea, including suspending \\nrestrictions on Ukrainian-language education and respecting ethnic Ukrainian \\nlanguage and educational rights, while this case is pending.” \\n The Court is fully aware of the context in which the present case has been brought before it, \\nin particular the fighting taking plac e in large parts of eastern Ukraine and the destruction, on \\n17 July 2014, of Malaysia Airlines Flight  MH17 while it was flying over Ukrainian territory en \\nroute between Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur, which have claimed a large number of lives. Nevertheless, the case before the Court is limited in scope. In respect of the events in the eastern \\npart of its territory, Ukraine has brought proceedings only under the ICSFT. With regard to the \\nevents in Crimea, Ukraine’s claim is based solely upon CERD and the Cou rt is not called upon, as \\nUkraine expressly recognized, to rule upon any issue other than allegations of racial discrimination \\nmade by the latter. II. PRIMA FACIE JURISDICTION (PARAS. 17-62) \\n The Court begins by observing that,  when a request for the indic ation of provisional \\nmeasures is submitted to it, it need not satisfy itself in a definitive manner that it has jurisdiction as \\nregards the merits of the case . In the present case, it notes that Ukraine seeks to found the \\njurisdiction of the Court on Article 24, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT and on Article 22 of CERD. The \\nCourt must therefore first seek to determine whether the jurisdictional clauses contained in these \\ninstruments prima facie confer upon it jurisdiction to rule on the merits of the case, enabling it — if \\nthe other necessary conditions are fulfilled — to indicate provisional measures. 1.

Existence of a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the ICSFT and CERD (paras. 22-39) \\n After observing that Ukraine and the Russian Federat ion are parties to both conventions at \\nissue in the present case, the Court points out that both Article  24, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT and \\nArticle 22 of CERD make the Court’s jurisdiction conditional on the existence of a dispute arising \\nout of the interpr etation or application of the respectiv e c onvention. At this stage of the \\npoint of law or fact between the two States;  and (2) whether that disagreement concer ns “the \\ninterpretation or application” of the respective convention. (a) The International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism  \\n(paras. 24-31) \\n The Court considers that, as it appears from the record of the proceedings, the Parties differ \\non the question of whether the events which occurred in eastern Ukra ine starting from the spring \\nof 2014 have given rise to issues relating to their rights and obligations under the ICSFT. It notes \\nthat Ukraine contends that the Russian Federation has failed to respect its obligations under \\nArticles 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 18. In particular, Ukraine maintains that the Russian Federation has \\nfailed to take appropriate measures to prevent the financing of terrorism in Ukraine by public and \\nprivate actor s on the territory of the Russian Federation and that it has repeatedly refused to \\ninvestigate, prosecute, or extradite “offenders within its territory brought to its attention by \\nUkraine”. The Russian Federation positively denies that it has committed an y of the violations set \\nout above. The Court considers that at least some of the allegations made by Ukraine appear to be \\ncapable of falling within the scope of the ICSFT ratione materiae . It is of the view that the \\nabove-mentioned elements are sufficien t at this stage to establish prima facie the existence of a \\ndispute between the Parties concerning the interpretation and application of the ICSFT. During the \\nhearings, the question of the definition of “funds” in Article  1, paragraph 1, of the Convention was \\nraised. The question was also raised whether acts of financing of terrorist activities by the State \\nitself fall within the scope of the Convention. For the purposes of determining the existence of a \\ndispute relating to the Convention, the Court considers that it does not need to make any \\npronouncement on these issues. (b) The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  \\n(paras. 32-39) \\n The Court considers that, as evidenced by the documents before it, the Parties differ on the \\nquestion of whether the events which occurred in Crimea starting from late February  2014 have \\ngiven rise to issues relating to their right s and obligations under CERD.',\n",

The State party submits that these allegations fail to \\ndescribe in sufficient detail how the above procedure violates article 3 or any other \\nprovision of the Convention or fail to provide for an effective remedy. It also notes that it is \\nnot within the scope of review of the Committee to consider the Canadian system in \\ngeneral, but only to examine whether, in the present case, the State party complied with its \\nobligations under the Convention. The State Party maintains that the allegation of lack of \\neffective remedy should be found inadmissible since it constitutes an allegation for \\nviolation of article 2 (3) of ICCPR and therefore it is not within the Committee’s \\njurisdiction under article 22, paragraph 1 of the Convention. 1 P.S.S v.

       "  'conclusion set out above that the ban on the Mejlis does not violate the Russian Federation’s obligations under CERD. With respect to the second provisional measure, the Court notes that the Order of 19 April 2017 required the Russian Federation to ensure that education in the Ukrainian language remains “available”. In this regard, the Court takes note of a report by the OHCHR, according to which \\n“instruction in Ukrainian was provided in one Ukrainian school and 13 Ukrainian classes in Russian \\nschools attended by 318 children”, which confirm s that instruction in the Ukrainian language was \\navailable after the adoption of the Order. While Ukraine has shown that a sharp decline in teaching \\nin the Ukrainian language took place after 2014, it has not been established that the Russian \\nFederation has violated the obligation to ensure the availability of education in the Ukrainian \\nlanguage contained in the Order on provisional measures. The Court therefore concludes that the Russian Federation has not violated the Order in so far \\nas it required the Respondent to ensure the availability of education in the Ukrainian language. In the Order on Provisional Measures, the Court also stated that “[b]oth Parties shall refrain \\nfrom any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute before the Court or make it more difficult \\nto resolve”. The Court observes that, subsequent to the Order on Provisional Measures, the Russian \\nFederation recognized the DPR and LPR as independent States and launched a “special military \\noperation” against Ukraine. In the view of the Court, these actions severely undermined the basis for \\nmutual trust and co-operation and thus made the dispute more difficult to resolve. For these reasons, the Court concludes that the Russian Federation violated the obligation under \\nthe Order to refrain from any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute before the Court or \\nmake it more difficult to resolve. B. Remedies (paras. 399-403) \\n The Court recalls that orders indicating provisional measures create a legal obligation for the \\nStates involved and that it is well established in international law that the breach of an engagement \\n The Court considers that its declaration that the Russian Federation has breached the Order on \\nprovisional measures of 19 April 2017 by maintaining the ban on the Mejlis  and has breached its \\nobligations under the non -aggravation measure contained in the same Order provides adequate \\nsatisfaction to Ukraine. Regarding Ukraine’s requests for restitution with respect to the Mejlis, the Court finds that, \\nsince it has concluded that the ban on the Mejlis does not violate the Russian Federation’s obligations \\nunder CERD, no restitution can be due after the date of this finding, the assessment at the provisional \\nmeasures stage having not been confirmed on the merits. The Court do es not find it necessary or appropriate to order any other remedy requested by \\nUkraine. OPERATIVE CLAUSE (PARA.',\n",
       "  'imposed by Article 18, “cooperate in the prevention of the offences set forth in article 2 by taking all practicable measures, inter alia, by adapting their domestic legislation, if necessary, to prevent and counter preparations in their respective territories for the commission of those offences within or outside their territories”. The Court observes that the object of Article 18, paragraph 1, is to foster co -operation in the \\nprevention of offences under Article  2, rather than to directly prevent the commission of those \\noffences. Accordingly, the Court considers that it is not necessary to find that the offence of terrorism \\nfinancing has been committed for a State party to have breached its obligations under Article  18, \\nparagraph 1, of the ICSFT. The Court next examines the types of measures encompassed by Article 18, paragraph 1. The \\nCourt considers that the ordinary meaning of the term “all practicable measures” supports a broader \\nreading of Article 18, paragraph 1, than the Respondent suggests. The provision, by its term s, \\nencompasses all reasonable and feasible measures that a State may take to prevent the commission \\nof the offence of terrorism financing under Article 2 of the ICSFT. Such measures include, but are \\nnot limited to, the adoption of a regulatory framework to monitor and prevent transactions with \\nterrorist organizations. The Court acknowledges that Article 18, paragraph 1, refers specifically to the obligation of \\nStates parties to the ICSFT to “adapt[] their domestic legislation”. However, this reference to \\nlegislative measures is preceded by the term “inter alia”, showing that it is only intended to be an \\nexample of the types of measures States are required to take, rather than a firm limit on the scope of \\nthe obligations imposed by Article 18. The Court also notes that Article 18 is the only article in the \\nICSFT that specifically mentions the “prevention” of terrorism financing offences. This context \\nsuggests that the phrase “all practicable measures” should not be interpreted too restrictively. Thus, \\nthe Court considers that Article 18, paragraph 1, encompasses a certain range of possible measures \\nto prevent terrorism financing, including, but not limited to, legislative and regulatory measures. The Court then turns to Ukraine’s submission that the Russian Federation has violated its \\nobligations under Article 18, paragraph 1. The Court recalls its finding in its 2019 Judgment that “all States parties to the ICSFT are \\nunder an obligation to take appropriate measures and to co-operate in the prevention and suppression \\nof offences of financing acts of terrorism committed by whichever person” (I.C.J. Reports 2019 (II), \\np. 585, para. 61). This includes actions taken to prevent terrorism financing by State officials. At the \\nsame time, however, the Court also recal ls its finding that “[t]he financing by a State of acts of \\nterrorism is not addressed by the ICSFT” and consequently “lies outside the scope of the Convention” \\n(ibid., p. 585, para. 59).',\n",
       "  'conclusion, the Court must then determine whether the Russian Federation met its obligation to undertake a meaningful investigati on into the facts alleged in the Notes Verbales. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation first responded to the Ukrainian communications in a Note Verbale dated 14 October 2014. In that communication, the \\nMinistry informed Ukraine about the “need to provide the Russian side with factual data on the issues \\nbrought up” in the Ukrainian communications. However, the Russian Federation provided no \\nclarification as to the precise additional information that was required. Subsequently, on 31 July 2015, in response to the information received from Ukraine, the \\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation sent Ukraine a Note Verbale that included \\nfurther details on the actions taken by the Russian competent authorities. This included the results of \\ninvestigations into two of the alleged offenders. In both cases, the Russian Federation concluded that \\nthe individuals were not involved in providing financial support to the DPR and LPR. However, no \\nclear information was provided by the Respondent concerning the other alleged offenders described \\nin the Ukrainian communications as being present in Russian territory. With regard to one allegation, \\nthe Russian Federation stated that it had issued orders to obtain the personal data and account \\ninformation of the alleged offenders. With respect to several other alleged offenders, the Russian \\nFederation responded that the persons either “d[id] not exist in the Russian Federation” or their \\nlocation could not be identified. Finally, with respect to the information received in the Ukrainian \\nNote Verbale of 29 August 2014, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs merely responded that the \\n“investigative and operational work to identify the persons mentioned . . . is being processed at [the] \\ncurrent time”. The Court takes note of the amount of time that elapsed before the Russian Federation provided \\nthe aforementioned responses to the Ukrainian Notes Verbales. In this regard, the Court observes \\nthat the 2019 Mutual Evaluation Report issued by the Financial Action Task Force regarding the \\nRussian Federation’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures stated that the \\nRussian Federation generally answers requests for mutual legal assistance “within one to two \\nmonths”. It is therefore notable that, almost one year after receiving the Ukrainian allegations, the \\nRussian Federation appeared to have failed even to identify several of the alleged offenders. Furthermore, to the extent the Respondent encountered difficulties asce rtaining the location or \\nidentity of some of the individuals named in the Ukrainian communications, it was required to seek \\nto co-operate with Ukraine to undertake the necessary investigations and specify to Ukraine what \\n In light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the Russian Federation has violated its \\nobligations under Article 9, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT. 3. Alleged violation of Article 10, paragraph 1 (paras. 112-120) \\n Article 10, paragraph 1, requires States parties to the ICSFT to either prosecute or extradite \\nalleged offenders of terrorism financing offences under Article 2.'])"

He claims that his return to India would constitute a violation by \\nCanada of article 3 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment. The complainant alleges lack of judicial control \\nrequired by the international human rights law on the administrative deportation decision \\nand that he did not have an effective remedy to challenge the deportation decision.

PRRA applications are considered by officers specially trained to assess risk and to consider the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms as well as Canada’s international obligations, including those under the Convention against Torture. The State party also makes reference to the complainant’s unsuccessful H&C application. The State party makes \\nreference to previous decisions of the Committee and other United Nation treaty bodies, \\nwhich have considered the judicial review\\n1 and PRRA process2 to be effective remedies. 4.5 The State party refers to the Committee’s constant view that it can not review \\ncredibility findings unless it can be demonstrated that such findings are arbitrary or \\nunreasonable; that the complainant has made no such allegations nor does the submitted \\nmaterial support a finding that the Board’s decision suffered from such defects. 4.6 The State party refers to the complainant’s claims that the Canadian refugee \\ndetermination and post-determination process were insufficient and did not meet \\ninternational human rights standards. The State party submits that these allegations fail to \\ndescribe in sufficient detail how the above procedure violates article 3 or any other \\nprovision of the Convention or fail to provide for an effective remedy. It also notes that it is \\nnot within the scope of review of the Committee to consider the Canadian system in \\ngeneral, but only to examine whether, in the present case, the State party complied with its \\nobligations under the Convention. The State Party maintains that the allegation of lack of \\neffective remedy should be found inadmissible since it constitutes an allegation for \\nviolation of article 2 (3) of ICCPR and therefore it is not within the Committee’s \\njurisdiction under article 22, paragraph 1 of the Convention. 1 P.S.S v.

It states that the \\nhuman rights situation for Sikhs in Punjab and India has improved to the extent that there is \\nnot a significant risk of torture or other ill-treatment on the part of the police, and that only \\nthose considered to be high-profile militants may still be at risk and refers to several reports \\nin support of that view. 4.10  The State party maintains that the complainant has failed to show in his submissions \\nthat he would be unable to lead a life free of torture in another part of India and makes \\nreference to the previous practice of the Committee that while the complainant may face \\nhardship should he not be able to return to his home, such hardship would not amount to \\ntorture or ill-treatment. 3 \\n4.11 In the event the Committee determines that the complainant’s communication is \\nadmissible, the State party requests that the communication be found without merit.

       "('The judgement in Nirmal Singh v. Canada is that the Committee against Torture concluded that the complainant, Nirmal Singh, has established a personal, present, and foreseeable risk of being tortured if he were to be returned to India, and therefore, Canada would be in violation of article 3 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment if it were to deport him to India.',\n",
       " ['complainant applied to the Federal Court for leave to apply for judicial review of the PRRA decision. The Federal Court dismissed his application without reasons on 14 August 2007. 2.14 On an unspecified date, the complainant applied to the Federal Court for a stay of execution of his removal order. A detailed affidavit about the present level of danger was \\nsubmitted with a motion for stay of deportation that was heard on 18 June 2007 and refused \\non 20 June 2007. The deportation of the complainant was scheduled for 21 June 2007. The complaint \\n \\n3.1 The complainant contends that he has exhausted all available and effective domestic \\nremedies. 3.2 The complainant claims a violation of article 3  of the Convention against Torture by \\nCanada if he is to be deported to India in the light of the treatment suffered by him in police \\ncustody the past and continuing interest in him by the police in India. 3.3 The complainant submits that Sikhs in India who are suspected of militant activities \\nare routinely arrested, tortured and murdered by police with impunity. He refers to the \\nreport on the situation of impunity published in the Harvard Human Rights Journal in 2002 \\n“A Judicial Blackout: \\nJudicial Impunity for Disappearances in Punjab”, which is claimed to be a leading authority \\non the current situation in Punjab. He further submits that as a result of being subjected to \\ntorture in the past, he suffers from post-trauma tic stress disorder, the diagnosis which is \\ncorroborated by medical reports from India and from Montreal. At the time of the \\nscheduled deportation there was an ongoing crisis in the Punjab and Haryana provinces. This crisis is said to have caused the central government to send large numbers of \\nparamilitaries to these two provinces. There had been a general strike and widespread \\nviolence in May and June 2007 among Sikhs and another religious sect. The complainant \\nclaims that individuals such as himself are routinely targeted by the police at the slightest \\nsign of political upheaval or disturbance. 3.4 The complainant also states that he did not have an effective remedy to challenge the \\ndeportation decision as guaranteed in article 2 of the International Covenant for Civil and \\nPolitical Rights (ICCPR). He explains that the judicial review of the Immigration Board \\ndecision, denying him Convention refugee status, is not an appeal on the merits, but rather a \\nvery narrow review for gross errors of law. In the context of deportation these proceedings \\nhave no suspensive effect. The complainant also submits that the PRRA procedure of risk \\nanalysis is implemented by immigration agents who are not competent in matters of \\ninternational human rights and are not independent, impartial and do not possess recognised \\ncompetence in the matter. He claims that in the immigration department there is an \\nextremely negative attitude towards refugee claimants and that its decisions do not undergo \\nindependent scrutiny as required by the international human rights law.',\n",
       "  'complainant travelled to Montreal where, on 28 March 2005, he filed an application for refugee status and protection. The complainant’s refugee claim was heard by the Immigration and Refugee Board (“the Board”) on 3 October 2005. On 16 November 2005, the Board determined that he was not a Convention refugee. The Board concluded \\nthat the applicant was not credible, that his behaviour was not remonstrative of a person \\nfearing for his life and that his departure related to the invitation by the Sikh religious \\ncommunity to work in Canada. 2.10  The complainant applied to the Federal Court for leave to apply for judicial review \\nof the Board’s Decision, which was granted on 16 March 2006. The request for judicial \\nreview of this decision was heard on 7 June 2006 and it was denied by the Federal Court on \\n13 June 2006. The standard that the Federal Court applied to the credibility of the findings \\nof the Board was that of “patent reasonableness”. The Court concluded that the decision \\nwas not patently unreasonable, largely on grounds of the delay in claiming refugee status \\nafter arrival to the country and failure to provide credible or trustworthy evidence as to the \\ncomplainant’s background information in India. 2.11  After the refusal of refugee status and the decision from the Federal Court, on 27 \\nDecember 2006, the complainant filed an application for stay for humanitarian reasons, (so \\ncalled H&C application), submitting additional evidence under article 25(2) of the \\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act. The application was refused on 27 March 2007 \\nby a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) Officer who concluded that the applicant did \\nnot establish that he would be at risk should he return to India. The complainant applied to \\nthe Federal Court for leave to apply for judicial review of the H&C decision, which was \\ndismissed without reasons on 6 September 2007. 2.12 On 12 December 2006, the complainant submitted an application for protection from \\nCanada under the PRRA programme. On 27 March 2007, the latter was rejected by the \\nsame PRRA Officer who refused the H&C application. The motivation was that the \\ndocumentary evidence submitted by the complainant did not demonstrate that he might be \\nlisted or wanted by the Indian authorities; that the complainant had never claimed that he \\nwas a Sikh militant or a supporter of the militants; that he had not established that he held a \\nhigh profile, nor that he was a person of inte rest for the Indian authorities. Therefore, the \\nevidence submitted by the complainant did not corroborate that he might face a personal \\nand objectively identifiable risk should he return to India. 5 \\n2.13 After the PRRA application was refused, the complainant applied to the Federal \\nCourt for leave to apply for judicial review of the PRRA decision. The Federal Court \\ndismissed his application without reasons on 14 August 2007. 2.14  On an unspecified date, the complainant applied to the Federal Court for a stay of \\nexecution of his removal order.',\n",
       "  'Koroma pointed out that it is in this sense that he understands the statement in the Judgment that \"the lawful~iess of the acts whicli a reservation to a declaration seeks to exclude from tlie jurisdiction of the Cc,urt has no relevance for the iiiterpretation of the terms of that reservation\". In other words, the Court\\'s jurisdiction to adjudicate in a \\ndispute derives fiom the Statute and the consent of a State as \\nexpressed in its declaration arid not from the applicable law. In the judge\\'s view, what was determinative in this \\nmatter was whether Canada had made a declaration under \\ntlie optional clause, whether that declaration excluded \\ndisputr:~ arising out of or concerning conservation and \\ntnaliagelnent measures and whether the acts complained of \\nfall within the category of the excluded acts. The Court in \\nrespon.ding affirmatively to those questions, not only \\nreached the right decision but affirmed that its compulsory \\njurisdiction is based 011 the previous consent o:F the State \\nconcerned and subject to the limits of that consent. Ac~:ordingly, and flowing from the above principles, \\nsince Canada had excluded fiom the jurisdiction of the \\nCourt \"disputes arising out of or concerning conservation \\nand management measures\", the questioil whether the Court \\nwas entitled to exercise its jurisdictioii must depend on the \\nsubject matter whicli had beell excluded and not on the \\napplicable laws or on the rules which were said to have been \\nviolated. Finally, Judge Koroma eiilphasized that this Judgment \\nshould not be viewed as an abdication of tlie Court\\'s judicial \\nfunction to pronounce on the validity of a declaration and its \\nreseivation, but rather should be seen as a reaffirniation of \\nthe principle that the character of a declaration makes it \\nnecessary for the Court to determine tlie scope and content \\nof the consent of a declarant State. The Court reserves its \\ninherent right to decide that a reseivation has been invoked \\nin bad faith, and to reject the view of the State in question. Separate opinion of Judge Kooiji~iai~s \\nJudge Kooijmans concurs with the Coui-t\\'s finding that it \\nhas no jurisdiction to entertain the dispute submitted by \\nSpain. He cast his vote, however, with a heavy heart since \\nthe Court\\'s Judgment bears testimony to the inherent \\nweakness of the optional clause system. The making of \\nreservations by a State to its declaration of acceptance of the \\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the Court under Article 36, \\nparagraph 2 of the Statute has never been coiitroversial \\n(with the exception of reservations which are contrary to the \\nStatute itself). The Court, therefore, has to apply the law as \\nit stands. In the present case Canada has submitted a new \\ndeclaration in whicli it added a reservation in order to \\nprevent the Court from scrutinizing the legality of an action \\nit intended to undertake. According to present internatiolial \\nlaw Canada was fully entitled to do so.',\n",

       "  'a militant, that despite his formal acquittal by the courts, the police continued to harass him, that he is well known to the authorities because of his activities as a Sikh priest, his political involvement with Akali Dal party and his leadership role in the local structures of the party. The Committee \\nobserves that the complainant has provided documentary evidence that he has a history of \\nbeing investigated and prosecuted as an alleged Sikh militant, that he was appointed as \\nSecretary General of the Haryana unit of the Akali Dal party and that he served as a Sikh \\npriest. The Committee accordingly considers that the complainant has provided sufficient \\nevidence that his profile is sufficiently high to put him at risk of torture if arrested. 6 See A.M. v. France, complaint No. 302/2006, Views of 5 May 2010, para 13.2; S.P.A. v. Canada,  \\n                            complaint No. 282/2005, Views of 7 November 2006, para 7.1. 11 \\n \\n8.6  The Committee notes the State party’s submission that the complainant has failed to \\nshow in his submissions that he would be unable to lead a life free of torture in another part \\nof India. The Committee, however, observes that the complainant has submitted evidence \\nthat he had been arrested in three different provinces - Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. The Committee also takes note of the evidence submitted that the Indian police continued \\nto look for the complainant and to question his family about his whereabouts long after he \\nhad fled to Canada. In light of these considerations, the Committee does not consider that \\nhe would be able to lead a life free of torture in other parts of India. 8.7 In the light of the foregoing, the Committee concludes that the complainant has \\nestablished a personal, present and foreseeable risk of being tortured if he were to be \\nreturned to India. 8.8  The complaint states that he did not have an effective remedy to challenge the \\ndecision on deportation and that the judicial review of the Immigration Board decision, \\ndenying him Convention refugee status, was not an appeal on the merits, but rather a very \\nnarrow review for gross errors of law. The State party in response submits that the Board’s \\ndecision was subject to judicial review by the Federal Court. The Committee notes that \\naccording to Section 18.1(4) of the Canadian Federal Courts Act , the Federal Court may \\nquash a decision of the Immigration Refugee Board if satisfied that: the tribunal acted \\nwithout jurisdiction; failed to observe a principle of natural justice or procedural fairness; \\nerred in law in making a decision; based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact; acted, \\nor failed to act, by reason of fraud or perjured evidence; or acted in any other way that was \\ncontrary to law. The Committee observes that none of the grounds above include a review \\non the merits of the complainant’s claim that he would be tortured if returned to India.'])"

Judge Koroma regretted that, in order to reach those \\nfindings, the Court not only had misinterpreted the ques- \\ntion-a misinterpretation which both distorted the inten- \\ntion of the questioa and proved fatal for the request-but \\nhad also had to depart from its jurisprudence according to \\nwhich it would only decline to render an advisory opinion \\nfor \"compelling reasons\".

By declining to render an opinion in this \\ncase the Court had, in his view, chosen to vacate its posi- \\ntive record in this sphere, particularly on an issue of such \\nvital importance that embraced not only a legal but a moral \\nand humanitarian dimension as well.

Judge Weeramantry disagreed with the view that United Nations agencies conducted their affairs within a strictly coinpartmentalized sche~me of division of functions. He \\ndisagreed with the Cou~t\\'s rigid application of the \"prin- \\nciple of speciality\" to \\\\YHO, so as to take the question \\nof legality out of its area of concern, merely because peace \\nant1 security fell withiin the concerns of the Security \\nCouncil. \\'The effects of nuclea~r weapons on health showed the \\nfutility of awaiting a nuclear catastrophe for INHO to move \\ninto action in providing medical services. The nuclear \\nweapon was, inter alia, the greatest cancer-inducing instru- \\nmentality yet devised. WHO was just as mu.ch entitled to \\ncorlcern itself with the legality of this agency of ill health \\nas it was to inquire into the legality of a cancer-inducing \\npharmaceutical product. Depending on the answer to that \\nquestion, it would have to adopt different strategies to deal \\nwith the problem. lvloreover, this was the first case ever in which the \\nCo.urt had refused to consider the request of\\' a specialized \\nagency of the United Nations for an advi:;ory opinion. Such a refusal should only be for compelling reasons. No \\nsuch reason has been shown to exist in the present case. Juclge Weeramantry\\'s view was that international law \\njoined with the imperatives of global health in requiring \\nthe Court to answer WHO\\'S request. Dissenting opinion of Judge Koroma \\nIn his dissenting opinion, Judge Koroma stated that \\nthe Court\\'s finding that it lacked jurisdiction to respond to \\nthe request by WHO was not only unprecedented but also \\ninconsistent with its own jurisprudence. He also disputed the Court\\'s finding that the question \\nposed by the Organization was outside its competence and \\nscope of activities. To reach that conclusion, Judge Koroma \\nmaintained that the Court had misconstrued the question \\nput by WHO as relating to the legality of the -use by a State \\nof nuclear weapons in a.rmed conflict. In his view, that \\nquestion related to the health and environmental effects of \\nnuclear weapons and to the problem of whether those effects \\nwollld be in breach of the obligations of Stiites, a matter \\nwhiich falls eminently within the competence and scope of \\nthe agency\\'s activities. He recalled that WHO is the specialized agency respon- \\nsible for the protection and the safeguarding of the health \\nof all peoples at the international level and its responsibili- \\nties include the taking of measures to prevent health prob- \\nlems like those which are bound to arise following the use \\nof nuclear weapons. In this connection, he pointed out that \\nthe Organization dealt primarily with preventive medicine.',\n",
       "  '\" (paras. 13-1 7) The Court observes that it has already had occasion to indicate that questions \"framed in terms of law and rais[ing] problems of inter- national law . . . are by their very nature susceptible of a reply based on law . . . [and] appear. . . to be questions \\nof a legal character\" (Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, \\nI.C.J. Reports 1975, p. 18, para. 15). It finds that the question put to the Court by the World \\nHealth Assembly does in fact constitute a legal question, \\nas in order to rule on the question submitted to it the Court \\nmust identify the obligations of States under the rules of \\nlaw invoked, and assess whether the behaviour in question \\nconforms to those obligations, thus giving an answer to the \\nquestion posed based on law. The fact that this question also has political aspects, as, \\nin the nature of things, is the case with so many questions \\nwhich arise in international life, does not suffice to deprive \\nit of its character as a \"legal question\" and to \"deprive the \\nCourt of a competence expressly conferred on it by its Stat- \\nute\". Nor are the political nature of the motives which may \\nbe said to have inspired the request or the political impli- \\ncations that the opinion given might have of relevance in \\nthe establishment of the Court\\'s jurisdiction to give such \\nan opinion. Question arising \"within the scope of the activities \" of \\nWhTO \\n(paras. 18-3 1) \\nThe Court observes that in order to delineate the field \\nof activity or the area of competence of an international \\norganization, one must refer to the relevant rules of the \\norganization and, in the first place, to its constitution. From \\na formal standpoint, the constituent instruments of interna- \\ntional organizations are multilateral treaties, to which the \\nwell-established rules of treaty interpretation apply. But \\nthey are also treaties of a particular type; their object is to \\ncreate new subjects of law endowed with a certain autonomy, \\nto which the parties entrust the task of realizing common \\ngoals. Such treaties can raise specific problems of interpre- \\ntation owing, inter alia, to their character which is conven- \\ntional and at the same time institutional; the very nature of \\nthe organization created, the objectives which have been \\nassigned to it by its founders and the imperatives asso- \\nciated with the effective performance of its functions, as \\nwell as its own practice, are all elements which may de- \\nserve special attention when the time comes to interpret \\nthese constituent treaties. According to the customary rule of interpretation as \\nexpressed in article 3 1 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on \\nthe Law of Treaties, the terms of a treaty must be inter- \\npreted \"in their context and in the light of its object and \\npurpose\" and there shall be \\n\"taken into account, together with the context: \\n(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the \\ntreaty which establishes the agreement. of the parties \\nregarding its interpretation\".',\n",

As to the weight to be given to certain kinds of evidence, the Court recalls that it will treat with caution evidentiary materials specially prepared for this case and also materials emanating from a single source. It will prefer contemporaneous evidence from persons with direct knowledge. It will \\ngive particular attention to reliable evidence acknowledging facts or conduct unfavourable to the \\nState represented by the person making them. The Court will also give weight to evidence that has \\nnot, even before this litigation, been challenged by impartial persons for the correctness of what it \\ncontains. The Court has also stated that the probative value of reports from official or independent bodies \\n“depends, among other things, on (1) the source of the item of evidence (for instance \\npartisan, or neutral), (2) the process by which it has been generated (for instance an \\n(3) the quality or character of the item (such as statement s against interest, and agreed \\nor uncontested facts)” (Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment \\nof the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v.

Reports 2022 (I), p. 56, \\npara. 122). The Court considers the probative value of such reports on a case-by-case basis, in accordance \\nwith these criteria. Concerning statements by witnesses, the Court recalls that “witness statements which are \\ncollected many years after the relevant events, especially when not supported by corroborating \\ndocumentation, must be treated with caution” ( Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo \\n(Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda), Reparations, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2022 (I), \\np. 63, para. 147). Moreover, the Court has noted that “any part of the testimony given which was not a statement of \\nfact, but a mere expression of opinion as to the probability or otherwise of the existence of such facts, \\nnot directly known to the witness . . . cannot take the place of evidence” (Military and Paramilitary \\nActivities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

In determining the probative value of evidence provided by a party, the Court also treats with caution \\nstatements by witnesses who are not disinterested in the outcome of the case, especially when not \\nsupported by corroborating documentation. In determining the evidentiary weight of any witness \\nstatement, the Court will take these considerations into account. Finally, the Court has held that certain materials, such as press articles and extracts from \\npublications, are regarded not as evidence capable of proving facts, but as material which can \\nnevertheless contribute, in some circumstances, to corroborating the existence of a fact, i.e.',\n",

The cold war, which inter- \\nvened shortly afterwards, prevented the development of \\nthis concept of illegality, while giving rise to the concept \\nof nuclear deterrence which has no legal value. The theory \\nof deterrence, while it has occasioned a practice of the \\nnuclear-weapon States and their allies, has not been able \\nto create a legal practice serving as a basis for the incipient \\ncreation of an international custom. It has, moreover, \\nhelped to widen the gap between Article 2, paragraph 4, of \\nthe Charter and Article 5 1. The Court should have proceeded to a constructive \\nanalysis of the role of the General Assembly resolutions. These have, from the outset, contributed to the formation \\nof a rule prohibiting nuclear weapons. The theory of deter- \\nrence has arrested the development of that rule and, while \\nit has prevented the implementation of the prohibition of \\nnuclear weapons, it is none the less still the case that that \\n\"bare\" prohibition has remained unchanged and continues \\nto produce its effects, at least with regard to the burden of \\nproof, by making it more difficult for the nuclear Powers \\nto vindicate their policies within the framework of the \\ntheory of deterrence.'])"

The State party subsequently informed the Committee that the complainant had not been deported. The facts as presented by the complainant \\n2.1  The complainant is a baptized Sikh and was a part-time Sikh priest in the Indian \\nprovinces of Punjab and Haryana. Because of his preaching activities, frequent travel in the \\nregion and well-built body, he was questioned and harassed by the Indian police on several \\noccasions. The Indian police suspected him of being a terrorist or a sympathiser of the \\nmilitant organization Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) in India, as well as having helped \\nmilitants by sheltering them. He was detained twice on false accusations, the first time for \\nover three years from 1988 to 1991, and the second time in 1995. 2.2 On 10 April 1988, officers of the Shahbad police station (Haryana province) arrested \\nthe complainant, his brother and three other individuals without explaining the reasons for \\ntheir arrest. At the police station the brothers were separated. The complainant was accused \\nof involvement in a murder in the city of Shahbad and of being associated with one Daya \\nSingh. The complainant denied the allegations. While in detention, the complainant was \\nseverely beaten and humiliated by the investigating officers and was forced to confess his \\nguilt. After three years of detention, the complainant and his brother were bailed out on 14 \\nMarch 1991 with a lawyer’s help. On 19 February 1998, the complainant was acquitted of \\nall charges related to the first accusation, but police officers continued to harass him under \\nthe pretext of visiting his home and place of religious services. 2.3 On 14 September 1995, an inspector of the Kotwali police station (Punjab province) \\naccompanied by police officers, raided the complainant’s house and arrested him. The \\ncomplainant was handcuffed and his house was searched but no illegal items were \\ndiscovered. The complainant was taken to the interrogation room at the police station and \\nquestioned by the inspector about one Paramjit Singh, who allegedly was involved in the \\nassassination of the Punjab Chief Minister. The inspector alleged that the complainant had \\nsheltered Paramjit Singh at his house before the Chief Minister’s assassination. The \\ninspector also stated that he had received secret information from the Haryana police that \\nthe complainant was associated with KLF and that another militant had reported to the \\npolice having sent Paramjit Singh to stay with the complainant. To make him confess his \\nlinks with Paramjit Singh, the police subjected the complainant to the following forms of \\ntorture: a heavy wooden roller was rolled over his thighs with the legs spread apart; he was \\nhung upside down and administered electric shocks; his soles were beaten with wooden \\nrods, and he was not allowed to sleep.\",\n",
       "  'is reliable and significant, as well as by any other methods of reliable proof. As to the weight to be given to certain kinds of evidence, the Court recalls that it will treat with caution evidentiary materials specially prepared for this case and also materials emanating from a single source. It will prefer contemporaneous evidence from persons with direct knowledge. It will \\ngive particular attention to reliable evidence acknowledging facts or conduct unfavourable to the \\nState represented by the person making them. The Court will also give weight to evidence that has \\nnot, even before this litigation, been challenged by impartial persons for the correctness of what it \\ncontains. The Court has also stated that the probative value of reports from official or independent bodies \\n“depends, among other things, on (1) the source of the item of evidence (for instance \\npartisan, or neutral), (2) the process by which it has been generated (for instance an \\n(3) the quality or character of the item (such as statement s against interest, and agreed \\nor uncontested facts)” (Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment \\nof the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. Serbia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2015 (I), p. 76, \\npara. 190; see also Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic \\nof the Congo v. Uganda), Reparations, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2022 (I), p. 56, \\npara. 122). The Court considers the probative value of such reports on a case-by-case basis, in accordance \\nwith these criteria. Concerning statements by witnesses, the Court recalls that “witness statements which are \\ncollected many years after the relevant events, especially when not supported by corroborating \\ndocumentation, must be treated with caution” ( Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo \\n(Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda), Reparations, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2022 (I), \\np. 63, para. 147). Moreover, the Court has noted that “any part of the testimony given which was not a statement of \\nfact, but a mere expression of opinion as to the probability or otherwise of the existence of such facts, \\nnot directly known to the witness . . . cannot take the place of evidence” (Military and Paramilitary \\nActivities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Me rits, Judgment, \\nI.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 42, para. 68). In determining the probative value of evidence provided by a party, the Court also treats with caution \\nstatements by witnesses who are not disinterested in the outcome of the case, especially when not \\nsupported by corroborating documentation. In determining the evidentiary weight of any witness \\nstatement, the Court will take these considerations into account. Finally, the Court has held that certain materials, such as press articles and extracts from \\npublications, are regarded not as evidence capable of proving facts, but as material which can \\nnevertheless contribute, in some circumstances, to corroborating the existence of a fact, i.e.',\n",

It observes, however, that reports submitted both by the complainant and the State party, confirm inter alia that numerous incidents of torture in police custody continue to take place, and that there is widespread impunity for perpetrators. The Committee observes that the existence of a \\nconsistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights in a country does not \\nas such constitute a sufficient ground for determining that a particular person was in danger \\nof being subjected to torture upon his return to that country; additional grounds must exist \\nto show that the individual concerned was personally at risk. 6 \\n8.3 The Committee notes that State party’s submission that it is not the role of the \\nCommittee to weigh evidence or reassess findings of fact and credibility made by \\ncompetent domestic decision-makers. According to the General Comment No. 1, paragraph \\n9, the Committee gives “considerable weight (…) to findings of fact that are made by \\norgans of the State party concerned (…) but the Committee is not bound by such findings \\nand instead has the power, provided by article 22, paragraph 4, of the Convention, of free \\nassessment of the facts based upon the full set of circumstances in every case”. The \\nCommittee notes that in the case under analysis, most of the facts are undisputed by the \\nparties, however the assessment of the legal consequences of the relevant facts are \\nchallenged. In this situation, the Committee should assess the facts in light of the State \\nparty’s obligations under the Convention. 8.4 The Committee observes that the complainant submitted evidence in support of his \\nclaims that he was tortured during detention on at least three occasions, in 1988, 1995 and \\n2003, including medical reports, as well as written testimony corroborating these \\nallegations. It also notes the medical reports from clinics in India and Canada, which \\nconclude that there is sufficient objective physical and psychological evidence \\ncorroborating his subjective account of torture and that the State party has not contested the \\ncomplainant’s allegations that he had been subjected to torture in the past. 8.5  The Committee notes the State party’s submission that the complainant has failed to \\ndemonstrate that he is a “high profile” person and therefore that he would be of interest for \\nthe Indian authorities. However, the Committee notes that the complainant contends he was \\ndetained and tortured because he was accused of being a militant, that despite his formal \\nacquittal by the courts, the police continued to harass him, that he is well known to the \\nauthorities because of his activities as a Sikh priest, his political involvement with Akali \\nDal party and his leadership role in the local structures of the party.',\n",
       "  'high deg ree of interpretive consistency to ensure conformity with Canada’s international obligations (para. 192). While neither Mr. Mason nor Mr. Dleiow is a Convention refugee, the IAD’s interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) could foreseeably impact Canada’s future compl iance with its non-refoulement obligations (see Jamal J.’s reasons, at paras. 104-17). My colleague views the IAD’s “fail[ure] to address the legal constraints \\nimposed by international law” as unreasonable (para. 104). With respect, I would have \\nconcerns, given the emphasis in Vavilov on a “reasons first” approach, with finding a \\ndecision to be “unreasonable” based on arguments that were not put before the \\nadministrative decision maker and that do not apply to the individuals actually before \\nthat decision maker. Correctness review of certified questions eliminates such concerns \\nand ensures respect for Canada’s international and treaty obligations. [173] The answers to certified questions under the IRPA may also have impacts \\non criminal law (see, e.g., Tran, at paras. 39-42). In such situations, a lack of clarity on \\nthe scope of inadmissibility under s.  34 may prevent accused persons from making \\ninformed decisions about whether to enter into a plea agreement. As Wagner  J. (as he \\nthen was) noted in R. v. Wong, 2018 SCC 25, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 696 (dissenting, but not \\n \\n[c]ollateral consequences that affect the accused person’s fundamental \\ninterests could have a more significant impact on the accused than the \\ncriminal sanction itself. As a result, it may be essential for an accused to \\nbe aware of such consequences in order to enter an informed guilty plea. This is particularly true in the immigration context, in which an accused \\nmay be exposed to a collateral consequence as serious as deportation. People who are to be deported may experience any number of serious \\nlife-changing consequences. They may be forced to leave a country they \\nhave called home for decades. They may return to a country where they no \\nlonger have any personal connections, or even speak the language, if they \\nemigrated as children. If they have family in Canada, they and their family \\nmembers face dislocation or permanent separation. [para. 72] \\n[174] In sum, certified questions tend to have significant consequences for the \\njustice system as a whole or for other institutions of government (Vavilov, at para. 59). In many cases, this will arguably place them within the existing category of general \\nquestions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole. If not, the \\ncombined effect of their broader significance and Parliament’s intent that they be \\ndecided by appellate courts justifies a departure from the presumption of \\nreasonableness review. [175] To be clear, this conclusion would not change the standard of review \\napplicable to the vast majority of administrative decisions under the IRPA. Decisions \\nof the Immigration and Refugee Board, as well as those made by various ministers, \\ngovernment departments, and agencies, would continue to be reviewed on a standard \\nof reasonableness in most cases.',\n",

Further, he contests that only high profile individuals are at risk of torture and refers to a 2003 Amnesty International report which demonstrates how deeply ingrained is the system of torture and abuse. He is also referring \\nto pages 25-28 of the Danish Immigration Service Report on Fact- finding Mission to \\nPunjab, India, 21 March to 5 April 2000 , where widespread torture and deaths in police \\ncustody are described. 5.6 The complainant submits that he is personally at risk of torture if returned to India \\nbecause: he had previously been accused of participation in militant activities in 1988 and \\nin 1995; he was detained for three and a half years between 1988 and 1991 and subjected to \\ntorture while in detention and previous detainees for militant activities are one of the main \\nrisk groups according to human rights reports; he was a prominent Sikh priest at some of \\nthe most important Sikh temples in Punjab and Haryana and therefore is a high-profile \\nfigure, since prominent Sikh religious figures are among the most targeted figures by the \\nsecurity services; he was a prominent figure in the Akai Dal in Haryana; he has personal \\nfamily links with well known militants, as confirmed by the submitted report of the Punjab \\nHuman Rights Organization. 5.7 The complainant contests the State party’s assertion that the torture with impunity in \\nIndia has ended and in support describes several cases where human rights defenders or \\nactivists of Akali Dal have been detained and tortured by the police. He also maintains that \\nafter the 2008 Mumbai attacks there was a great wave of detentions, false accusations and \\ntorture taking place against large parts of the political class. The complainant also refers to \\nthe 2005 report of the Organization ENSAAF, entitled Punjab Police: Fabricating \\nTerrorism through Illegal Detention and Torture , which talks about large quantity of \\n \\n \\n                   4 Case of Amir Shahin Sokhan, Imm-3067-96, 7 July 1997.

He \\nsubmits that his political activities would make him particularly vulnerable to detention and \\ntorture if he were to be returned. 6.1  By Note Verbale of 17 July 2009, the State party submits that the Fact-Finding \\nReport Regarding Nirmal Singh,  presented by the complainant, contains no new evidence \\ndemonstrating that there were substantial grounds to believe that the latter would personally \\nbe at risk of torture if returned to India. 6.2  Should it be determined that the report contains new evidence, the State party \\nsubmits that the complainant should present it first to Canadian immigration authorities, \\nthat the complainant has not exhausted domestic remedies as required by article 22 (5)(b) of \\nthe Convention and therefore it is inadmissible.'])"

      "AI Answer: The key legal principles established in the UN Committee Against Torture case against Canada are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Effective Remedy**: The Committee emphasized the importance of an effective remedy against deportation to a country where there is a risk of torture. The Committee found that Canada's judicial review process and Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) procedure did not provide an effective remedy in this case, as they did not allow for a review of the merits of the complainant's claim that he would be tortured if returned to India.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Non-Refoulement**: The Committee reaffirmed the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits states from returning individuals to a country where they would face a real risk of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The Committee found that Canada's decision to return the complainant to India would constitute a breach of this principle.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Credibility Assessments**: The Committee noted that it can review credibility findings if they are arbitrary or unreasonable. However, in this case, the Committee did not find that the Canadian authorities' credibility assessment was arbitrary or unreasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Risk Assessment**: The Committee emphasized that a risk assessment must be individualized and take into account the specific circumstances of the complainant. The Committee found that the Canadian authorities' risk assessment was inadequate, as it did not sufficiently consider the complainant's personal circumstances and the risk of torture he faced if returned to India.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Scope of Review**: The Committee clarified that its review is limited to determining whether the state party has complied with its obligations under the Convention Against Torture, and does not extend to a general review of the state party's system or laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Article 22 of the Convention**: The Committee found that Canada had violated Article 22 of the Convention, which requires states to provide an effective remedy against deportation to a country where there is a risk of torture. The Committee also found that Canada had violated Article 3 of the Convention, which prohibits refoulement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the Committee's decision emphasizes the importance of providing an effective remedy against deportation to a country where there is a risk of torture, and highlights the need for individualized risk assessments that take into account the specific circumstances of the complainant.\n",

The \\nnine affiants who answered written cross -examinations stated that, after their return, \\nthey were detained by American authorities. With one exception, they were released \\nfrom detention pursuant to an administrative decision or bond hearing. Likewise, they \\nmade asylum claims in the United States with the assistance of counsel. One affiant \\ncould not meet the bond set for their release. That individual was removed from the \\nUnited States after unsuccessfully appealing the i mmigration judge’s unfavourable \\ndecision to the American Board of Immigration Appeals and, subsequently, to the \\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit. A. Federal Court, 2020 FC 770, [2021] 1 F.C.R. 209 (McDonald J.) [20] The appellants challenged the validity of s. 159.3 of the IRPR on the basis \\nthat the designation of the United States was outside the authority granted by the IRPA. They also said that s.  159.3 of the IRPR and s.  101(1)(e) of the IRPA unjustifiably \\nviolated ss. 7 and 15 of the Charter. The Federal Court judge rejected the argument \\nthat the regulation was ultra vires but found an unjustified s. 7 breach. Because of her \\nconclusion on s. 7, she declined to rule on the s. 15 claim. [21] The vires argument was rejected because Canadian Council for Refugees \\nv. Canada, 2008 FCA 229, [2009] 3 F.C.R. 136 (“CCR (2008)”), at para. 57, held that \\nwhether a regulation is within the authority delegated by a statute is assessed based on \\nfacts at the time of promulgation. [22] The Federal Court judge found that the Charter applied. Deprivations \\neffected by foreign actors remain “subject to the guarantee of fundamental justice, as \\nlong as there is a sufficient causal connection between our government’s participation \\nand the deprivation” (para. 100, citing Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and \\nImmigration), 2002 SCC 1, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3; see also Federal Court reasons, at \\npara. 93, citing Bedford, at paras. 58 and 75-76). [23] In the Federal Court judge’s view, the impugned scheme engages “liberty” \\nbecause “ineligible [Safe Third Country Agreement] claimants are . . . immediately and \\n \\nperson given the risk of refoulement and the conditions of detention in the United \\nStates. She found there was a “real and not speculative” risk that ABC would have been \\nrefouled from the United States based on “the challenges in advancing an asylum \\nclai[m] for those detained”, such as barriers to accessing legal advice (para. 106).')"

Lastly, we noted that the use of force in arresting the \\nEstai and in harassing other Spanish vessels on the high \\nseas, as well as the use of force contemplated in \\nCanadian Bills C-29 and C-8, can also not be included in \\nthe Canadian reservation, because it contravenes the \\nprovisions of the Charter.

On 10 May 1994 Canada deposited with the Secretary- \\nGeneral of the United Nations a new declaration of \\nacceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. Canada\\'s prior declaration of 10 September 1985 had \\nalready contained the three reservations set forth in \\nsubparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 2 of the new \\ndeclaration. Subparagraph (4 of the 1994 declaration, \\nhowever, set out a new, fourth reservation, further excluding \\nfrom the jurisdiction of the Court \"(4 disputes arising out of \\nor concerning conservation and management measures \\ntaken by Canada with respect to vessels fishing in the \\nNAFO Regulatory Area, as defined in the Convention on \\nFuture Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic \\nFisheries, 1978, and the enforcement of such measures.\" On the same day that the Canadian Government \\ndeposited its new declaration, it submitted to Parliament Bill \\nC-29 amending the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act by \\nextending its area of application to include the Regulatory \\nArea of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization \\n(NAFO). Bill C-29 was adopted by Parliament, arid received \\nthe Royal Assent on 12 May 1994. The Coastal Fisheries \\nProtection Regulations were also amended, on 25 May \\n1994, and again on 3 March 1995. when Spanish and \\nPort~~guese fishing vessels were taken up in Table IV of \\nSection 21 (the category of fishing vessels which were \\nprohibited from fishing for Greenland halibut in the area \\nconcerned). On 12 May 1994, following the adoption of Bill C-8, \\nCanada also amended Section 25 of its Criminal Code \\nrelating to the use of force by police officers and other peace \\nofficers enforcing the law. This Section applied as well to \\nfisheries protection officers.'), Document(metadata={'case_title': 'Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v.

Spain contends that an \\nexercise of jurisdiction by Canada over a Spanish vessel on \\nthe high seas entailing the use of force falls outside of \\nCanada\\'s reservation to the Court\\'s jurisdiction. The Court notes that, following the adoption of Bill C- \\n29, the provisions of the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act \\nare of a character and type to be found in legislation of \\nvarious nations dealing with fisheries conservation and \\nmanagement, as well as in Article 22 (1) @ of the United \\nNations Agreement on Straddling Stocks of 1995. The \\nlimitations on the use of force specified in the Coastal \\nFisheries Protection Regulations Amendment of May 1994 \\nalso bring the authorized use of force within the category \\nfamiliar in connection with enforcement of conservation \\nmeasures. The Court further notes that the purpose of other \\nCanadian enactments referred to by Spain appears to have \\nbeen to control and limit any authorized use of force, thus \\nbringing it within the general category of nieasures in \\nenforcement of fisheries conservation. For all of these reasons the Court finds that the use of \\nforce authorized by the Canadian legislation and regulations \\nfalls within the ambit of what is commonly understood as \\nenforcement of conservation and management measures and \\nthus falls under the provisions of paragraph 2 (4 of \\nCanada\\'s declaration. This is so notwithstanding that the \\nreservation does not in terms mention the use of force. Boarding, inspection, arrest and minimum use of force for \\nthose purposes are all contained within the concept of \\nenforcement of conservation and management measures \\naccording to a \"natural and reasonable\" interpretation of this \\nconcept. The Court concludes by stating that in its view, the \\ndispute between the Parties, as it has been identified in this \\nJudgment, had its origin in the amendments made by \\nCanada to its coastal fisheries protection legislation and \\nregulations and in the pursuit, boarding and seizure of the \\nEstcri which resulted therefrom. Equally, the Court has no \\ndoubt that the said dispute is very largely concerned with \\nthese facts. Having regard to the legal characterization \\nplaced by the Court upon those facts, it concludes that the \\ndispute submitted to it by Spain constitutes a dispute \\n\"arising out of\\' and \"concerning\" \"conservation and \\nmanagement measures taken by Canada with respect to \\nvessels fishing in the NAFO Regulatory Area\" and \"the \\nenforcement of such measures\". It follows that this dispute \\ncoines within the terms of the reservation contained in \\nparagraph 2 (4 of the Canadian declaration of 10 May \\n1994.'), Document(metadata={'case_title': 'Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada)', 'court': 'International Court of Justice (ICJ)', 'file_name': 'FISHERIES JURISDICTION.pdf', 'chunk_index': 15, 'score': 0.8719437718391418}, page_content='and \"concerning\" \"conservation and management measures taken by Canada with respect to vessels fishing in the NAFO Regulatory Area\" and \"the enforcement of such measures\". It follows that this dispute coines within the terms of the reservation contained in paragraph 2 (4 of the Canadian declaration of 10 May 1994. The Court consequently has no jurisdiction to \\nPresident Schwebel, in a separate opinion, held tliat, \\ncontrary to Spain\\'s argument, a reservation to a declaration \\nunder the optional clause is not ineffective insofar as it \\nexcludes actions by the declarant State that are illegal under \\ninternational law. A very purpose of a reservation may be to \\ndebar the Court from passing upon legally questionable \\nactions. Nor does Canada\\'s reservation embody a self-judging \\nproviso in violation of the authority of the Court to \\ndetermine its jurisdiction. Spanish counsel argued that Canada\\'s reservation as \\ninterpreted by Canada is \"a nullity\" and that it \"excludes \\nnothing, since it can apply to nothing\". While not accepting \\nthis argument, President Schwebel concluded that if, \\narguendo, these contentions of Spain are correct, it follows \\nthat tlie nullity or ineffectiveness of tlie reservation entails \\ntlie nullity of the declaration as a whole. The Canadian \\nreservation is an essential element of the declaration, but for \\nwhich the declaration would not have been made. When, as \\nin this case, the reservation has been treated by the declarant \\nas such an essential one, the Court is not free to hold the \\nreservation invalid or ineffective while treating the \\nremainder of the declaration to be in force. If the Spanish \\nargument on the results to be attached to Canada\\'s \\ninterpretation of the reservation is accepted, there is no basis \\nwhatever in this case for the jurisdictioli of the Court. Sepui-ate opinion of Judge Oda \\nJudge Oda fully concurs with the operative part of the \\nJudgment. Judge Oda nonetheless considers it appropriate, lest the \\nreal issues in the case should be buried in obscurity, to spell \\nout what issues existed in the dispute between Canada and \\nSpain. He considers that the subject of the \"dispute\" in the \\npresent case relates to the Estai incident. In his view, \\nCanada\\'s legislative enactments in 199411995 are to be \\nexamined, but oidy in the context of that incident. The Estui \\nincident occurred in the \"Regulatory Area\" of the 1979 \\nNAFO Convention, which area lies beyond the exclusive \\neconomic zone where the coastal States exercise fisheries \\njurisdiction. Judge Oda makes it plain that, within the \\nframework of the NAFO Convention, the adoption of \\nmeasures of conservation and management of fishery \\nresources in the Regulatory Area is the ~esponsibility of the \\nNAFO Fisheries Commission, but not of any particular \\ncoastal State. He has stressed that the whole chain of events \\nregarding the Estai incident unfolded irrespective of the \\nNAFO Convention.')]\n",
