# Agentic Legal Assistant  

An **AI-powered legal assistant** built with **Streamlit** that leverages **agentic reasoning** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to answer legal queries. The system integrates **multiple domain-specific embeddings** and advanced **LLMs (Groq + Gemini 2.0 Flash)** to provide accurate, contextual, and explainable responses.

## üöÄ Features  

- ‚öñÔ∏è **Legal-Specific Knowledge**: Uses three specialized embedding collections:  
  - **InLegalBERT** ‚Äì Indian legal documents *(law-ai/InLegalBERT)*  
  - **LegalBERT** ‚Äì General legal text corpora *(nlpaueb/legal-bert-base-uncased)*  
  - **All-MiniLM-MPNet v2** ‚Äì General semantic similarity *(sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2)*  

- ü§ñ **Agentic RAG Pipeline**: Combines retrieval + reasoning for accurate responses.  

- üß† **Memory with Summarization**: Uses **Gemini 2.0 Flash** to summarize old chat history into compact memory.  

- ‚ö° **Groq-Powered LLMs**: Ultra-fast inference for legal query answering.  

- üí° **User-Friendly UI**: Interactive **Streamlit app** with built-in **help and tips**.  

- üí¨ **Chat Sessions**:  
  - Persistent chat history stored in **MongoDB**.  
  - Multiple sessions with **unique titles per user**.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture  

1. **Document Storage**: Legal documents embedded and stored across 3 collections (InLegalBERT, LegalBERT, MPNet).  
2. **Retriever**: Hybrid retrieval mechanism queries relevant passages from all collections.  
3. **Agentic Orchestration**: LangChain agents decide which tools/collections to use.  
4. **LLM Layer**:  
   - **Groq Models** ‚Äì reasoning & query answering.  
   - **Gemini 2.0 Flash** ‚Äì summarizing chat history into memory.  
5. **UI Layer**: Streamlit app with guidance & tips for users.
