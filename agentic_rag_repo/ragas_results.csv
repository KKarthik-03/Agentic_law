What was the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in the case concerning Fisheries Jurisdiction between Spain and Canada?,"['lack of title to act on the high seas against vessels flying the Spanish flag, the fact that Canadian fisheries legislation cannot be invoked against Spain, and reparation for the wrongful acts perpetrated against Spanish vessels. These matters are not included in Canada\'s reservation to the jurisdiction of the Court. We also noted that Canada cannot claim to \nsubordinate the application of its reservatioii to the sole \ncriterion of its national legislation and its own appraisal \nwithout disregarding your competence, under Article 36, \nparagraph 6, of the Statute, to determine your own \njurisdiction. Lastly, we noted that the use of force in arresting the \nEstai and in harassing other Spanish vessels on the high \nseas, as well as the use of force contemplated in \nCanadian Bills C-29 and C-8, can also not be included in \nthe Canadian reservation, because it contravenes the \nprovisions of the Charter. For all the above reasons, we ask the Court to \nadjudge and declare that it has jurisdiction in this case."" On behalf of the Canadicrn Government, at the sitting of \n17 June 1998: \n""May it please the Court to adjudge and declare that \nthe Court has no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the \nApplication filed by Spain on 28 March 1995."" Background to the case \n(paras. 13-22) \nThe Court begins with an account of the background to \nthe case. On 10 May 1994 Canada deposited with the Secretary- \nGeneral of the United Nations a new declaration of \nacceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. Canada\'s prior declaration of 10 September 1985 had \nalready contained the three reservations set forth in \nsubparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 2 of the new \ndeclaration. Subparagraph (4 of the 1994 declaration, \nhowever, set out a new, fourth reservation, further excluding \nfrom the jurisdiction of the Court ""(4 disputes arising out of \nor concerning conservation and management measures \ntaken by Canada with respect to vessels fishing in the \nNAFO Regulatory Area, as defined in the Convention on \nFuture Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic \nFisheries, 1978, and the enforcement of such measures."" On the same day that the Canadian Government \ndeposited its new declaration, it submitted to Parliament Bill \nC-29 amending the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act by \nextending its area of application to include the Regulatory \nArea of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization \n(NAFO). Bill C-29 was adopted by Parliament, arid received \nthe Royal Assent on 12 May 1994. The Coastal Fisheries \nProtection Regulations were also amended, on 25 May \n1994, and again on 3 March 1995. when Spanish and \nPort~~guese fishing vessels were taken up in Table IV of \nSection 21 (the category of fishing vessels which were \nprohibited from fishing for Greenland halibut in the area \nconcerned). On 12 May 1994, following the adoption of Bill C-8, \nCanada also amended Section 25 of its Criminal Code \nrelating to the use of force by police officers and other peace \nofficers enforcing the law. This Section applied as well to \nfisheries protection officers.', 'accepted, for it runs contirary to a clear text, which, moreover, appears to express the intention of its author. Neither can the Court share the conclusions drawn by Spain from tlie parliamentary debates cited by it. Meaning aizd scope of the phi-use ""uitd the erlforceinent of suclz nzeaszrres "" (paras. 78-84) \nThe Court then examines the phrase ""and the \neiforcemeizt of szrclt riteasui-es"", on the meaning and scope \nof which the Parties disagree. Spain contends that an \nexercise of jurisdiction by Canada over a Spanish vessel on \nthe high seas entailing the use of force falls outside of \nCanada\'s reservation to the Court\'s jurisdiction. The Court notes that, following the adoption of Bill C- \n29, the provisions of the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act \nare of a character and type to be found in legislation of \nvarious nations dealing with fisheries conservation and \nmanagement, as well as in Article 22 (1) @ of the United \nNations Agreement on Straddling Stocks of 1995. The \nlimitations on the use of force specified in the Coastal \nFisheries Protection Regulations Amendment of May 1994 \nalso bring the authorized use of force within the category \nfamiliar in connection with enforcement of conservation \nmeasures. The Court further notes that the purpose of other \nCanadian enactments referred to by Spain appears to have \nbeen to control and limit any authorized use of force, thus \nbringing it within the general category of nieasures in \nenforcement of fisheries conservation. For all of these reasons the Court finds that the use of \nforce authorized by the Canadian legislation and regulations \nfalls within the ambit of what is commonly understood as \nenforcement of conservation and management measures and \nthus falls under the provisions of paragraph 2 (4 of \nCanada\'s declaration. This is so notwithstanding that the \nreservation does not in terms mention the use of force. Boarding, inspection, arrest and minimum use of force for \nthose purposes are all contained within the concept of \nenforcement of conservation and management measures \naccording to a ""natural and reasonable"" interpretation of this \nconcept. The Court concludes by stating that in its view, the \ndispute between the Parties, as it has been identified in this \nJudgment, had its origin in the amendments made by \nCanada to its coastal fisheries protection legislation and \nregulations and in the pursuit, boarding and seizure of the \nEstcri which resulted therefrom. Equally, the Court has no \ndoubt that the said dispute is very largely concerned with \nthese facts. Having regard to the legal characterization \nplaced by the Court upon those facts, it concludes that the \ndispute submitted to it by Spain constitutes a dispute \n""arising out of\' and ""concerning"" ""conservation and \nmanagement measures taken by Canada with respect to \nvessels fishing in the NAFO Regulatory Area"" and ""the \nenforcement of such measures"". It follows that this dispute \ncoines within the terms of the reservation contained in \nparagraph 2 (4 of the Canadian declaration of 10 May \n1994.', 'and ""concerning"" ""conservation and management measures taken by Canada with respect to vessels fishing in the NAFO Regulatory Area"" and ""the enforcement of such measures"". It follows that this dispute coines within the terms of the reservation contained in paragraph 2 (4 of the Canadian declaration of 10 May 1994. The Court consequently has no jurisdiction to \nPresident Schwebel, in a separate opinion, held tliat, \ncontrary to Spain\'s argument, a reservation to a declaration \nunder the optional clause is not ineffective insofar as it \nexcludes actions by the declarant State that are illegal under \ninternational law. A very purpose of a reservation may be to \ndebar the Court from passing upon legally questionable \nactions. Nor does Canada\'s reservation embody a self-judging \nproviso in violation of the authority of the Court to \ndetermine its jurisdiction. Spanish counsel argued that Canada\'s reservation as \ninterpreted by Canada is ""a nullity"" and that it ""excludes \nnothing, since it can apply to nothing"". While not accepting \nthis argument, President Schwebel concluded that if, \narguendo, these contentions of Spain are correct, it follows \nthat tlie nullity or ineffectiveness of tlie reservation entails \ntlie nullity of the declaration as a whole. The Canadian \nreservation is an essential element of the declaration, but for \nwhich the declaration would not have been made. When, as \nin this case, the reservation has been treated by the declarant \nas such an essential one, the Court is not free to hold the \nreservation invalid or ineffective while treating the \nremainder of the declaration to be in force. If the Spanish \nargument on the results to be attached to Canada\'s \ninterpretation of the reservation is accepted, there is no basis \nwhatever in this case for the jurisdictioli of the Court. Sepui-ate opinion of Judge Oda \nJudge Oda fully concurs with the operative part of the \nJudgment. Judge Oda nonetheless considers it appropriate, lest the \nreal issues in the case should be buried in obscurity, to spell \nout what issues existed in the dispute between Canada and \nSpain. He considers that the subject of the ""dispute"" in the \npresent case relates to the Estai incident. In his view, \nCanada\'s legislative enactments in 199411995 are to be \nexamined, but oidy in the context of that incident. The Estui \nincident occurred in the ""Regulatory Area"" of the 1979 \nNAFO Convention, which area lies beyond the exclusive \neconomic zone where the coastal States exercise fisheries \njurisdiction. Judge Oda makes it plain that, within the \nframework of the NAFO Convention, the adoption of \nmeasures of conservation and management of fishery \nresources in the Regulatory Area is the ~esponsibility of the \nNAFO Fisheries Commission, but not of any particular \ncoastal State. He has stressed that the whole chain of events \nregarding the Estai incident unfolded irrespective of the \nNAFO Convention.']","The Supreme Court of Canada did not hear the case concerning Fisheries Jurisdiction between Spain and Canada.

Why did Judge Koroma dissent from the Court's finding that it lacked jurisdiction to respond to the WHO's request? from Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict case,"['principles of treaty interpretation and should rather have interpreted W1-10\'s Constitution in the light of its object and pur- pose-""to promote and protect the health 01\' all peoples"". Judge Weeramantry disagreed with the view that United Nations agencies conducted their affairs within a strictly coinpartmentalized sche~me of division of functions. He \ndisagreed with the Cou~t\'s rigid application of the ""prin- \nciple of speciality"" to \\YHO, so as to take the question \nof legality out of its area of concern, merely because peace \nant1 security fell withiin the concerns of the Security \nCouncil. \'The effects of nuclea~r weapons on health showed the \nfutility of awaiting a nuclear catastrophe for INHO to move \ninto action in providing medical services.

Such a refusal should only be for compelling reasons. No \nsuch reason has been shown to exist in the present case. Juclge Weeramantry\'s view was that international law \njoined with the imperatives of global health in requiring \nthe Court to answer WHO\'S request. Dissenting opinion of Judge Koroma \nIn his dissenting opinion, Judge Koroma stated that \nthe Court\'s finding that it lacked jurisdiction to respond to \nthe request by WHO was not only unprecedented but also \ninconsistent with its own jurisprudence. He also disputed the Court\'s finding that the question \nposed by the Organization was outside its competence and \nscope of activities. To reach that conclusion, Judge Koroma \nmaintained that the Court had misconstrued the question \nput by WHO as relating to the legality of the -use by a State \nof nuclear weapons in a.rmed conflict. In his view, that \nquestion related to the health and environmental effects of \nnuclear weapons and to the problem of whether those effects \nwollld be in breach of the obligations of Stiites, a matter \nwhiich falls eminently within the competence and scope of \nthe agency\'s activities. He recalled that WHO is the specialized agency respon- \nsible for the protection and the safeguarding of the health \nof all peoples at the international level and its responsibili- \nties include the taking of measures to prevent health prob- \nlems like those which are bound to arise following the use \nof nuclear weapons. In this connection, he pointed out that \nthe Organization dealt primarily with preventive medicine.', 'is none the less still the case that that ""bare"" prohibition has remained unchanged and continues to produce its effects, at least with regard to the burden of proof, by making it more difficult for the nuclear Powers to vindicate their policies within the framework of the theory of deterrence. Separate opinion of Judge Oda \nJudge Oda, while being in agreement with the Court\'s \ndecision that the request should be dismissed as well as \nwith the reasoning leading to that decision, nevertheless \nwishes to make clear his view that the Court should have \ntaken more note of the fact that it was asked not only \nwhether the use of nuclear weapons would be a breach of \nthe obligations of States under international law but \nwhether it would also be a breach of the obligations of \nStates under the WHO Constitution. Judge Oda is very concerned that the Court may be \nseised of more requests for advisory opinion which may in \nessence be unnecessary and oversimplistic. He stressed that \nthe advisory function should only be used in cases of con- \nflict or dispute and not merely to discuss general matters \nof international law. He also pointed out that advisory opinions had been \nrequested by specialized agencies in three previous cases \nin the history of the Court, but strictly in order to solve one \nor more legal questions arising within the scope of their \nactivities. This precedent has not been followed in the pres- \nent case. Judge Oda points out that the request of WHO was \ndrafted without there being any real agreement among the \ndelegates in the World Health Assembly and, in particular, \nthat it was brought to the Court contrary to the repeated \nadmonitions of the Legal Counsel of WHO, who contended \nthat the Organization was not competent to bring this \nmatter to the Court under Article 96 (2) of the Charter of \nthe United Nations. Dissenting opinion of Judge Shahabuddeen \nThc: main reason for Judge Shahabuddeen\'s dissent is \nthat, in his respectful view, the Court has mistaken the \nmeaning of WHO\'S question. Contrary to the Court\'s im- \npression, WHO is not asking whether the use of nuclear \nweapons by one of its members is lawful under interna- \ntional law as a general matter; a more reasonable interpre- \ntation of the question is that WHO is asking whether such \nuse would be a breach of a member\'s obligations under \ninternational law but only in so far as it would also be a \nbreach of its obligations under the Constitution of WHO. WHO would have to deal with the health and environ- \nmental effects produced by the action of a member even if \nthat action is in breach of the member\'s obligations under \nthat Constitution; but it nevertheless remains competent for \nWHO to concern itself with the question whether, in pro- \nducing a situation demanding action by WHO, a member \nmay have breached its obligations under that Constitution.', 'of a member even if that action is in breach of the member\'s obligations under that Constitution; but it nevertheless remains competent for WHO to concern itself with the question whether, in pro- ducing a situation demanding action by WHO, a member may have breached its obligations under that Constitution. Dissenting opinion of Judge Weeramantry \nJudge Weeramantry, in his dissenting opinion, stated \nthat the question asked by the World Health Organization \nrelated to obligations in three particular areas: \n(a) State obligations in regard to health; \n(b) State obligations in regard to the environment; and \n(c) State obligations under the WHO Constitution. The question asked by WHO was substantially different \nfrom the general question of legality of use or threat of use \nof nuclear weapons, asked by the General Assembly. However, the Court had treated it as a question of general \nillegality, and had not examined State obligations in the \nthree areas mentioned. Had the Court inquired into these three areas, it would \nhave found that each of them was intimately linked with \nthe legitimate concerns of WHO and that, in each of these \nareas, State obligations were violated by nuclear weapons. Judge Weeramantry, in his opinion, examines the health- \nrelated and environmentally related effects of nuclear \nweapons to show the diametrical contrast between those \neffects and the obligations of States, both as members of \nthe international community, in general, and as subscribing \nparties to the WHO Constitution. Judge Weeramantry strongly disagreed with the majority \nof the Court, who had held that WHO3 question was out- \nside the scope of its legitimate sphere of interest. His view, \non the other hand, was that the question asked by WHO \nwas entirely within its legitimate and constitutional sphere \nnuclear weapon, which was the greatest man-made threat \nto human health thus far devised. WHO was the only health authority to which the world \nwould have to turn for international assistance if a country \nwere stricken with a nuclear attack, for its own health services \nwould have collapsed. !vloreover, even neutral countries \nnor involved in the dispute, which would be affected by the \nradiation and other effect.s of nuclear weapons, would need \nto turn to WHO for assistance in such a:n eventuality. Global health was central to the question, just as global \nhealth was central to the concerns of WHO. :planning and prevention were essential ports of the ac- \ntivities of all health authorities, and this general principle \nunquestionably applied to WHO, which needs the legal \ninformation requested, for precisely this purpose. \'The Court\'s decision was based on restricted principles \nof treaty interpretation and should rather have interpreted \nW1-10\'s Constitution in the light of its object and pur- \npose-""to promote and protect the health 01\' all peoples"".
